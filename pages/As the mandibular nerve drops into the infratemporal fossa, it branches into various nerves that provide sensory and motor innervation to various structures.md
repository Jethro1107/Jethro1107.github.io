- ### As the mandibular nerve drops through the infratemporal fossa, it branches into various nerves that provide sensory and motor innervation to various structures
  collapsed:: true
	- When the mandibular division of the [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]] branches from the trigeminal ganglion ( ((63b385a4-72ae-466e-bf59-be67c8d25e9d)) ), it drops through the foramen ovale on the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the [[Sphenoid bone]].
	- The smaller motor root also descends medially along the trigeminal ganglion through the foramen ovale, and fuses with the mandibular nerve, such that it provides sensory and motor innervation (contrasting to V1 and V2 divisions, which are purely sensory).
	- ### Branches of the mandibular nerve
	  collapsed:: true
		- Immediately as the mandibular nerve drops through the foramen ovale, it gives rise to the **meningeal nerve** and the **nerve to medial pterygoid**, and subsequently gives rise to the  **anterior trunk** and **posterior trunk**.
		- **Meningeal nerve**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The meningeal nerve (or the recurrent meningeal nerve) originates from the medial side of the mandibular nerve, and accompanies the middle meningeal artery through the **foramen spinosum** of the spenoid bone, into the cranial cavity.
			- It provides:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Sensory innervation to the ((63b385f7-f906-4514-bbb9-af3464db1087)) of the middle cranial fossa ([[The cranial base is is separated into three cranial fossas]]).
		- **Nerve to medial pterygoid**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The nerve to medial pterygoid also originates from the medial side of the mandibular nerve, and descends along the deep surface of the medial pterygoid.
			- It provides:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Motor innervation to the medial pterygoid.
		- **Anterior trunk**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The anterior trunk mainly consist of motor fibres (with the exception of the buccal nerve, which consist of sensory component).
			- **Masseteric nerve**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The masseteric nerve passes through the mandibular notch between the condylar process and coranoid process ([[Mandible]]).
				- It provides:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Motor innervation to the masseter muscle from its deep surface.
			- **Deep temporal nerve**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The deep temporal nerve (2 parallel nerves) ascend through the gap deep to the zygomatic arch, deep to the temporalis muscle.
				- It provides:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Motor innervation to the temporalis muscle from its deep surface.
			- **Nerve to lateral pterygoid**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The nerve to lateral pterygoid passes deep to the lateral pterygoid.
				- It provides:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Motor innervation to the lateral pterygoid from its deep surface.
			- **Buccal nerve**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The buccal nerve emerges from between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid, and descends along the anterior margin of the ramus of the mandible.
				- It provides:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Sensory innervation to the skin of the cheek, oral mucosa of the cheek, and buccal gingivae of the mandibular molar.
		- **Posterior trunk**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The posterior trunk mainly consist of sensory fibres (except the branch to myohyoid, a branch of inferior alveolar nerve).
			- **Auricotemporal nerve**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The Auricotemporal nerve *originates as two roots that wraps around the middle meningeal artery*, and fuses.
				- It passes between the ((63b38605-476e-4014-a802-8b6fded8f278)) and the upper head of the lateral pterygoid, and then between the sphenomandibular ligament and the neck of the mandible, the eventually ascends deep to the parotid gland between the [[Temporomandibular joint]] and the ear.
				- It provides:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Sensory innervation to the external ear, external acoustic meatus, tympanic membrane and the [[Temporomandibular joint]].
					- Postganglionic fibres to the parotid gland pass via the octic ganglion, and hitchhike via the auriculotemporal nerve to provide parasympathetic innervation to the [[Parotid glands]].
			- **Lingual nerve**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The lingual nerve passes anteriorly to the inferior alveolar nerve.
				- It provides:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Somatosensation to the lingual anterior 2/3 of the tongue, lingual gingivae, and oral mucosa of the floor of the [[Oral cavity]].
					- Taste fibres from the taste buds of the tongue.
					- Preganglionic parasympathetic fibres in greater petrosal nerve hitchike via the lingual nerve to the submandibular ganglion, providing parasympathetic innervation to the submandibular and sublingual glands.
			- **Inferior alveolar nerve**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The inferior alveolar nerve passes posterior to the lingual nerve.
				- It descends deep to lateral pterygoid, where it descends between the sphenomandibular ligament and neck of mandible, and essentially passes descend through the mandibular canal via the mandibular foramen ( ((63b7faef-ca79-4800-b32b-32ae277d40ab)) ) .
				- Before it enters the mandibular canal, it gives rise to the nerve to myohyoid.
				- It eventually branches to give the incisive nerves and terminates as the mental nerve as it passes through the mental foramen of the [[Mandible]].
