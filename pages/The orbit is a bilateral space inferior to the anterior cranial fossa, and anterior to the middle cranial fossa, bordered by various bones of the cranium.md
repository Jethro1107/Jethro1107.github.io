- ### The orbit is a bilateral space inferior to the anterior cranial fossa, and anterior to the middle cranial fossa, bordered by various bones of the cranium
  collapsed:: true
	- The orbit is roughly pyramidal, with its apex at the orbital foramen, and its base at the **orbital rim**.
	- **The orbital rim is bordered:**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Superiorly by the [[Frontal bone]]
		- Medially by the  frontal process of the [[Maxilla]]
		- Inferiorly by the [[Maxilla]]
		- Laterally by the frontal process of the [[Zygomatic bone]]
	- **Roof of the orbit**
	  id:: 63c4026c-5b7a-4f06-8070-788d47647d6d
	  collapsed:: true
		- The roof of the orbit is mainly formed by the **orbital part** of the [[Frontal bone]].
		- Posteriorly, it receives small contributions from the lesser wing of the [[Sphenoid bone]].
	- **Floor of the orbit**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The floor of the orbit is formed by the orbital part of the [[Maxilla]], with small contributions from the [[Zygomatic bone]] and the [[Palatine bone]].
	- **Medial wall of the orbit**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The medial wall of the orbit is mainly formed by the **orbital plate** of the [[Ethmoid bone]] (lateral to the ethmoid labyrinth).
		- Anterior to the ethmoid bone, it is formed by the **lacrimal bone**, and also the [[Maxilla]].
		- Between the two bones is the **lacrimal groove**, which houses the **lacrimal sac**.
	- **Lateral wall of the orbit**
		- The lateral wall of the orbit is formed anteriorly by the [[Zygomatic bone]], and posteriorly by the greater wing of the [[Sphenoid bone]].
