			 - Perfusion depends on the pressure difference between arterial pressure and venous pressure (or alveolar pressure, if alveolar pressure is greater than that of venous pressure)

			 - Pulmonary arterial pressure decreases as we move up the lung due to gravitational effects

			 - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FJethro%2FWO8yMITQaj.png?alt=media&token=5a175cc1-93b5-4e78-9ffc-dd8ebe1f19cf)

			 - There may be a region at the top of the lung (zone 1), where pulmonary arterial pressure falls below alveolar pressure (normally close to atmospheric pressure). If this occurs, the capillaries are squashed flat, and no flow is possible. Zone 1 does not occur under normal conditions, because the pulmonary arterial pressure is just sufficient to raise blood to the top of the lung, but may be present if the arterial pressure is reduced (e.g., with septic shock or hemorrhage) or if alveolar pressure is raised, as occurs during positive pressure ventilation. This ventilated but unperfused lung is useless for gas exchange and is called alveolar dead space.

			 - Farther down the lung (zone 2), pulmonary arterial pressure increases because of the hydrostatic effect and now exceeds alveolar pressure. However, venous pressure is still very low and is less than alveolar pressure, which leads to remarkable pressure-flow characteristics. Under these conditions, blood flow is determined by the difference between arterial and alveolar pressures (not the usual arterial-venous pressure difference). Indeed, venous pressure has no influence on flow unless it exceeds alveolar pressure.

			 - In zone 3, venous pressure now exceeds alveolar pressure, and flow is determined in the usual way by the arterial-venous pressure difference. The increase in blood flow down this region of the lung is apparently caused chiefly by distension of the capillaries. The pressure within them (lying between arterial and venous) increases down the zone, while the pressure outside (alveolar) remains constant. Thus, their transmural pressure rises and, indeed, measurements show that their mean width increases. Recruitment of previously closed vessels may also play some part in the increase in blood flow down this zone.

	 - **Main mechanisms for regulation of pulmonary blood flow→hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction**
		 - Effects of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction #sr
id:: 7aed98b1-563c-416d-948f-1bcf713ffcae
			 - Alveolar oxygen tension (alveolar PO2) regulates pulmonary circulation

			 - Decrease in alveolar PO2 (Alveolar hypoxia) causes vasoconstriction in small pulmonary arteries, while an increase in alveolar PO2 causes vasodilation in small pulmonary arteries and arterioles

		 - Physiological significance of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in decrease in local PO2 #sr
id:: 03f9b351-cad7-4238-bd71-e7aeb253ce81
			 - When local PO2 decreases, it results in local vasoconstriction, thus diverting blood flow away from the hypoxic region, thereby reducing the deleterious effects on gas exchange

		 - Effects of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in global decrease in PO2 #sr
id:: c34b9707-bfa9-4a56-be19-7759d60138ff
			 - When global PO2 decreases, it results in a generalized pulmonary vasoconstriction, causing an increase pulmonary arterial pressure, and increased work for the right heart, eventually resulting in right heart hypertrophy and failure if severe

			 - Pathological condition of right heart disorder caused by primary lug disorder
				 - Cor pulmonale

- Ventilation-perfusion inequality
	 - **Dye-water model showing the effects of ventilation-perfusion inequality**

	 - **Importance of ventilation-perfusion ratio**
		 - Normal ventilation-perfusion ratio of a lung unit
			 - The normal ventilation-perfusion ratio of the lung as a whole is 0.8

	 - **Effects of altering ventilation-perfusion ratio of a lung unit**
		 - Effects on alveolar partial pressure of gases as a result of decrease in VQ ratio due to obstructed ventilation
			 - When ventilation is obstructed, and blood flow is kept normal, VQ ratio is reduced, and alveolar PO2 decreases and alveolar PCO2 increases

			 - When airway is completely obstructed, i.e. there is no ventilation, VQ ratio equals to zero, the PO2 and PCO2 of alveoli and end-capillary blood thus equilibrates with that of systemic venous blood

		 - Effects on alveolar partial pressure of gases as a result of increase in VQ ratio due to obstructed blood flow
			 - When blood flow is obstructed and ventilation is kept normal, VQ ratio is increased, and alveolar PO2 increases and alveolar PCO2 decreases

			 - When blood flow is completely obstructed, i.e. there is no perfusion, VQ ratio approaches infinity, the PO2 and PCO2 of alveoli and end-capillary blood thus equilibrates with that of inspired air

	 - Regional gas exchange in the lung
		 - Regional Gas Exchange in the Lung (West's Respiratory Physiology)
			 - Ventilation and perfusion are not constant throughout the lung, and, instead vary from top to bottom due to the effects of gravity and other factors. This has implications for ventilation-perfusion ratios across the lung which affects the exchange of gases in the different regions. We saw in [Figures 2.7](https://meded-lwwhealthlibrary-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacySectionId=west11-ch002-fig007) and [4.7](https://meded-lwwhealthlibrary-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacySectionId=west11-ch004-fig007) that ventilation increases slowly from top to bottom of the lung and blood flow increases more rapidly ([Figure 5.9](about:blank)). As a consequence, the ventilation-perfusion ratio is abnormally high at the top of the lung (where the blood flow is minimal) and much lower at the bottom. We can now use these regional differences in ventilation-perfusion ratio on an O2-CO2 diagram ([Figure 5.8](about:blank)) to depict the resulting differences in gas exchange.

			 - Note that the ventilation-perfusion ratio decreases down the lung.

			 - (From West JB. Ventilation/Blood Flow and Gas Exchange. 5th ed. Oxford, UK: Blackwell; 1990.)

			 - [Figure 5.10](about:blank) shows the upright lung divided into imaginary horizontal “slices,” each of which is located on the ventilation-perfusion line by its own ventilation-perfusion ratio. This ratio is high at the apex, so this point is found toward the right end of the line, whereas the base of the lung is to the left of normal (compare [Figure 5.8](about:blank)). It is clear that the Po2 of the alveoli (horizontal axis) decreases markedly down the lung, whereas the Pco2 (vertical axis) increases much less.

			 - [Result of combining the pattern of ventilation-perfusion ratio inequality shown in](about:blank)[Figure 5.9](about:blank) with the effects of this on gas exchange as shown in [Figure 5.8](about:blank).

			 - Note that the high ventilation-perfusion ratio at the apex results in a high Po2 and low Pco2 there. The opposite is seen at the base.

			 - (From West JB. Ventilation/Blood Flow and Gas Exchange. 5th ed. Oxford, UK: Blackwell; 1990.)

			 - [Figure 5.11](about:blank) illustrates the values that can be read off a diagram like [Figure 5.10](about:blank). (Of course, there will be variations between individuals; the chief aim of this approach is to describe the principles underlying gas exchange rather than determine specific values.) Note first that the volume of the lung in the slices is less near the apex than the base. Ventilation is less at the top than the bottom, but the differences in blood flow are more marked. Consequently, the ventilation-perfusion ratio decreases down the lung, and all the differences in gas exchange follow from this. Note that the Po2 changes by over 40 mm Hg, whereas the difference in Pco2 between apex and base is much less. The variation in Pn2 is, in effect, by default because the total pressure in the alveolar gas is the same throughout the lung.

			 - [Regional differences in gas exchange down the normal lung.](about:blank)

			 - Only the apical and basal values are shown for clarity.

			 - The regional differences in Po2 and Pco2 imply differences in the end-capillary concentrations of these gases, which can be obtained from the appropriate dissociation curves ([Chapter 6](https://meded-lwwhealthlibrary-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacySectionId=west11-ch006)). Note the surprisingly large difference in pH down the lung, which reflects the considerable variation in Pco2 of the blood. The minimal contribution to overall O2 uptake made by the apex can be mainly attributed to the very low blood flow there. The difference in CO2 output between apex and base is much less because this can be shown to be more closely related to ventilation. As a result, the respiratory exchange ratio (CO2 output/O2 uptake) is higher at the apex than at the base. On exercise, when the distribution of blood flow becomes more uniform, the apex assumes a larger share of the O2 uptake.

		 - Changes in regional ventilation-perfusion ratio up the lung
			 - Ventilation decreases slowly as we move up the lung, and blood flow decreases rapidly as we move up the lung, as a result VQ ratio increases non-linearly as we move up the lung, with abnormally high VQ ratio at the apex of the lung, and extremely low at the base of the lung
