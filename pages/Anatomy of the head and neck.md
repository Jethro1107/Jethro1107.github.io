			- Vascular supply of the face
				- Arterial supply of the face is mainly supplied by the [[Facial artery]], a branch of [[External carotid artery]].
				- The face is also supplied by the transverse facial artery, a branch of the ((63b28d00-950e-4b0b-a2c4-c513d0337cc8)) .

		- [[Posterior triangle of the neck]]
		- Nose
			- The nose is a key feature of the frace, and encloses what is called the [[Nasal cavity]].
			- A osteocartiligeous framework enclose the nasal cavity. [[The external nose skeleton forms the anterior part of the nasal cavity]], and is highly variable in nature. The [[The nasal septum is an osteocartilaginous structure that separates the two nasal cavities|Nasal septum]] forms the medial wall of the nasal cavity, and separates the two nasal cavity. Various bones of the [[Cranium]] also contribute to the [[Bony framework of the roof, floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity]].
