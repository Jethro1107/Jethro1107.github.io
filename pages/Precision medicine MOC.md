- The Human genome
	 - [[Packaging of the human genome]]
		 - The human genome consist of 3 billion base pairs, packaged into a nucleus

		 - To enable packaging in such a small space, the human genome is packaged into [[chromosomes]]

		 - {{embed  ((d5c60240-8f14-416c-a22d-ff78b8e7a8b4))}}

		 - The human genome is a diploid (paired chromosomes), consisting of 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 paired autosomes, 1 paired allosomes)

		 - In [[The Human genome]], 1.2% of base pairs consist of of around 20000 genes

	 - [[Properties of a functional genome]]
		 - A functional genome must be organised

		 - A functional genome must be usable (able to be regulated and expressed)

		 - A functional genome must be stable

		 - A functional genome must be able to replicated accurately to the progeny cells

	 - [[genetic variations]]

- Genetic inheritance and diseases
	 - [[Mendelian disorders]]

	 - [[Sex-linked disorders]]

	 - [[Mitochondrial disorders]]

- Population genetics
	 - 

- Hereditability
	 - Traits may be monogenic, polygenic and multifactorial
		 - Monogenic traits - Traits that are controlled by one gene

		 - Polygenic traits - Traits that are controlled by more than one gene

		 - Multifactorial traits - Traits that are controlled by genes and other factors

	 - Concept of hereditability
		 - Hereditability refers to the perentage of variation explained by genetics

	 - Hereditability of height (Nature vs Nurture)
		 - Height is a multifactorial trait

		 - Hereditability of height - 60-80%

		 - Other factors (nutrition, diseases) - 20-40%

- Prenatal/Newborn screening
	 - [[Genetic testing is conducted in 3 phases]]
		 - pre-implantation testing (for in vitro firtilization)
			 - The objective is to find viable embryos post IVF for implantation

			 - pre-implantation testing is classified into [[pre-implantation genetic screening]] and [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]]

		 - pre-natal (during pregnancies)
			 - New challenges arise in pre-natal testing, as it requires accessing of fetal cells via invasive routes

			 - However, discovery of fetal cell free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal DNA

		 - post birth

- Rare disease diagnosis
	 - [[Rare diseases as a group are not rare]]
		 - Case study: [[Nick Volker]] [[Book - One in a billion]]

- Direct-to-consumer genetic testing
	 - Direct to consumer genetic testing reports on risk of diseases and pocession of traits, they also provide drug response prediction, carrier status and ancestry information

	 - Important considerations when using DTC genetic testing

	 - Most calculated risk is based on a reference population, hence must consider whether reference population is appropriate for a particular individual
		 - Reference populations nowadays usually europeans

		 - Non-genetic factors complicate risk prediction

- Cancer somatic testing
	 - [[Cancer is caused by somatic mutations]]

	 - Cancer somatic testing informs the use of target therapy
