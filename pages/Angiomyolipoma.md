		 - A rare benign renal neoplasm characterised by blood vessels, smooth muscles and fat

	 - [[**Cell of origin of angiomyolipoma**]]
		 - Originate from perivascular epitheloid cells

	 - [[**How is angiomyolipoma usually discovered?**]]

	 - [[**Gross pathology of angiomyolipoma**]]
		 - Often forming large tumours, which may haemorrhage (may be fatal)

		 - Increase in tumour size and risk of haemorrhage associated with pregnancies
