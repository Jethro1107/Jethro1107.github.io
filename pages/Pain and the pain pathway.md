- # Pain and the pain pathway
- ### Definition of pain
	- Textbook definition: Pain is defined as an **unplesant sensation**, and **emotional experience** precipitated by **actual or potential tissue damage**.
	- How I refined the definition: Pain is regarded as a special [[Somatosensation]] mediated by *tissue damage* (any ailments of the body), that results in an *unplesant sensation*, and has significant *emotional component*.
- ### [[Fast pain and slow pain and their qualities]]
- ### Similar to other components of somatosensation, pain pathway is mediated at [3 levels]([[Somatosensory pathways are generally organised in a 3 neuron system]])
  collapsed:: true
	- Receptor level
		- Pain signals is detected by [[Nociceptors]].
	- Circuit Level
		- Similar to somatosensation, [[Somatosensory pathways are generally organised in a 3 neuron system]].
			- 1st order neuron - [[Dual pathway for transmission of pain signals into the central nervous system underlies fast and slow pain]].
			- 2nd order neuron:
				- Lateral [Spinothalamic tract]([[Spinothalamic pathway]]) for *pain stimuli in the limb and trunks*
				- [[Trigeminothalamic tract]] for *pain stimuli in the head and neck*
			- But a very small portion of 2nd order neuron actually projects to the 3rd order neurons in the Ventral posterior nucleus of the [[Thalamus]], which projects to the primary somatosensory complex for discriminative aspects of pain perception.
			- Much of it project to the limbic system for affective aspects of pain, underlying the emotional components of pain.
