- ### Varying properties of basilar fibres along the basilar membrane in the cochlea results in a tonotopic organisation along the basilar membrane
  collapsed:: true
	- The height of basilar fibres increase along the basilar membrane, but its diameter decreases along the basilar membrane.
	- Hence, basilar fibres in the base is short and stiff, and hence resonate at high frequencies.
	- Basilar fibres in the helicotrema is long and floppy, and hence resonate at low frequencies.
