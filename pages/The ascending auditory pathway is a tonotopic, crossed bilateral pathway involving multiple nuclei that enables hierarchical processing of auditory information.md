- ### The ascending auditory pathway is a tonotopic, crossed, bilateral pathway involving multiple nuclei that enables hierarchical processing of auditory information
  collapsed:: true
	- **The pathway is briefly described below:**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Upon stimulation, cochlear fibres project via the cochlear nerve and *synapses with second order neurons* within the cochlear nucleus.
		- Cochlear nucleus then projects to the **superior olivary nucleus**.
		- The superior olivary nucleus then project upwards via the **lateral lamniscus** towards the **inferior colliculus of the brainstem**.
		- The inferior colliculus then projects to the **medial geniculate body** on the pulvinar of the [[Thalamus]], which projects to the auditory cortex.
	- **There are certain features of the ascending auditory pathway:**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Firstly, it is a crossed, bilateral system, in a sense that both sides are activated for comparing between the left and the right.
		- Secondly, It has tonotopic organisation along the entire pathway, underlying what Guyton calls "**Place Principle**".
		- Thirdly, there is **hierarchical organisation along the pathway**, where auditory information is processed in a hierarchical manner.
