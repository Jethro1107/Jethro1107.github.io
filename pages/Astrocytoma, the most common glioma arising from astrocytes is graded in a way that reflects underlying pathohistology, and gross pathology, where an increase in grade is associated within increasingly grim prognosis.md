- ### Astrocytoma, the most common glioma arising from astrocytes is graded in a way that reflects underlying pathohistology, and gross pathology, where an increase in grade is associated within increasingly grim prognosis
  collapsed:: true
	- Astrocytoma, the most common form of glioma, is a neoplasm arising from astrocytes, that *commonly affects adults, but also children*.
	- **Astrocytoma can be classified by the type of astrocytes they originate from**:
		- Fibrillary astrocytoma
		- Pilocytic astrocytoma
		- Cf: [[IAS38 Neural Architecture]]: ((63bd7dfd-5fed-4fee-ab34-567804dc32b1))
	- **Gross pathology of astrocytoma**
		- Grade 1 astrocytomas (Circumscribed pilocytic astrocytoma in children) are circumscribed.
		- Grade 2 or 3 astrocytomas are usually difuse, with no well-demarcated margins (infiltration beyond grossly defined margins is common).
		- Cystic degeneration is common.
	- **Histological features stratifies astrocytoma into different grades**
		- Grade 1 astrocytoma (Pilocytic astrocytoma in children) are well-circumscribed.
		- Grade 2 astrocytoma is associated with **nuclear pleomorphism**.
		- Grade 3 astrocytoma is associated with increased **mitosis**.
		- Grade 4 astrocytoma is associated with necrosis (as the tumour outgrows its vascular supply), and **vascular endothelial hyperplasia** (as marked ischaemia due to its rapid growth triggers release of angiogenic factors such as VEGF that trigger angiogenesis).
	- An increase in grade correlates to worsening prognosis, Grade 4 astrocytoma, or [[Glioblastoma Multiformes]] having the worst prognosis.
