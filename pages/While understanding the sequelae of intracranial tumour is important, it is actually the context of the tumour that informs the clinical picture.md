- ### While understanding the sequelae of intracranial tumour is important, it is actually the context of the tumour that informs the clinical picture
  collapsed:: true
	- All intracranial tumours (primary or metastatic) has the potential that causes [[Raised intracranial pressure]], which results in the sequelae of herniation ([[Herniation is a sequelae of raised intracranial pressure]]), which underlies the pathophysiology of intracranial tumours.
	- While classification and grading of intracranial tumours is very important, *they rarely inform the clinical picture.*
	- *The clinical picture largely depends on the context of the tumour*, particularly the **rate of growth**, and the **location** of the tumour:

		- Even low grade tumours, when grown in the "correct" location, compressing on the "right" structures, can result in severe neurological deficits, and may be fatal.
		- Hence, symptomatology, corresponding to the anatomy, can greatly inform the clinical picture.
