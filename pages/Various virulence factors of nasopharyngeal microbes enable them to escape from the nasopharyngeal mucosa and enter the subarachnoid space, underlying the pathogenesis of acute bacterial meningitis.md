- ### Various virulence factors of nasopharyngeal microbes enable them to escape from the nasopharyngeal mucosa and enter the subarachnoid space, underlying the pathogenesis of acute bacterial meningitis
  collapsed:: true
	- Most forms of acute bacterial meningitis is caused by nasopharyngeal microbes that have colonised the nasopharyngeal mucosa (especially during winter).
	- This is because they bear the right combination of **virulence factors** that enable them to escape the nasopharyngeal mucosa and enter the subarachnoid space.
	- **The pathogenesis of acute bacterial meningitis is as follows:**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The infective process begins with asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharyngeal mucosa.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Fimbrae of the microbe enables attachment to the mucosa.
			- Protease secreted by the microbe enables it to evade mucosal immunity (IgA)
		- The microbe via phagocytosis accesses the bloodstream.
		- Prolonged bacteremia usually preceeds meningitis.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Capsule from the microbe enables it to be phagocytic.
			- They may also enter monocytes, which serves as a 'trogen's horse' for it to enter the subarachnoid space.
		- Prolonged bacteremia provides opportunities for the microbe to enter the subarachnoid space,  crossing the blood brain barrier by transcytosis.
		- Within the defenceless subarachnoid space (with the lack of complements, WBC and immunoglobins), microbes proliferate uninhibitedly.
		- The bacterial cell wall and LPS may activate Toll-like receptors (TLR) on endothelial cells and macrophages, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL6 and TNF).
		- This results inflammation, and oedema, and [[Raised intracranial pressure]] .
		- It also results in septic thrombosis, which results in ischaemia and cerebral infarction.
