- ### Basal ganglia
	- The basal ganglia is one of the components of the extrapyramidal [[Motor system]].
	- **The basal ganglia consist of 5 motor nuclei**
		- The 5 motor nuclei are 1) **Caudate nucleus**, 2) **Globus pallidus**, 3) **Putamen**, 4) **Subthalamic nucleus**, 5) [[Substantia niagra]].
		- The first 3 is found deep into the cerebrum.
		- Caudate nucleus
		  id:: 63b385a9-e193-451a-9865-4931752da77a
			- The C-shaped caudate nucleus is located *immediately lateral to the ((63b38608-09dd-4933-a5c4-d224a8458aa0)).
		- Globus pallidus
		  id:: 63b385a9-e32a-4dde-b089-ad7885454ba2
			- The globus pallidus is a small motor nucleus located lateral to the **internal capsule**, and medial to the Putamen.
			- It is subdivided into the globius pallidus internus, and globius pallidus externus.
		- Putamen
		  id:: 63b385a9-8af8-4e03-87d7-2fe0c991125e
			- The putamen lies lateral to the globus pallidus.
		- Subthalamic nucleus
			- The subthalamic nucleus is located in the subthalamus of the diencephalon.
		- [[Substantia niagra]]
			- The substantial niagra is located ventrally of the [[Midbrain]], deep to the cerebral peduncle.
		- The collection of globus pallidus and putamen forms the **lentiforms**, and the collection of the 3 cerebral motor nucleus is called the **striatum** (or corpus striatum).
			- The communication between the caudate nucleus and putamen is broken up by the passage of [[Internal capsule]], resulting in a striated pattern of its fibres, hence, **corpus striatum**.
