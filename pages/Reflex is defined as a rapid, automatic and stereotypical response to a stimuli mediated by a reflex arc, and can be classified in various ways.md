- ### Reflex is defined as a rapid, automatic and stereotypical response to a stimuli mediated by a reflex arc, and can be classified in various ways

		- Reflex is defined as a *rapid, automatic and predictable (stereotypical) response to a stimuli*, mediated by a **reflex arc**.
	- **Composition of a reflex arc**
	  collapsed:: true
		- A reflex arc consist of a receptor, a sensory neuron, an integration centre, a motor neuron and an effector.
		- Receptor - detects the stimuli
		- Sensory neuron - transmits impulse from the receptor to the CNS (integration centre)
		- Integration centre - part of the CNS which interprets the sensory information and coordinates a response to the stimuli
		- Motor neuron - transmits impulse from CNS (integration centre) to effector
		- Effector - muscle or gland (depending on the type of reflex) that produces a response under the influence of the motor neuron

	- **Classification and examples of reflex**
	  collapsed:: true
		- By number of synapse involved: Monosynaptic reflex and polysynaptic reflex
		- By development: Inborn reflex vs Acquired reflex
		- By CNS component involved: Cranial reflex vs Spinal reflex
		- By effector: Somatic reflex vs autonomic reflex
			- Examples of somatic reflex: [[Stretch reflex]], [[Golgi tendon reflex]]
			- Examples of autonomic reflex: Baroreceptor reflex, Chemoreceptor reflex, Defaecation reflex, Micturition reflex, [[Pupillary light reflex]]
