- Urate-lowering agents
- Urate-lowering agents are used to lower serum uric acid level, by modulating different parts of [[Uric acid metabolism]].
- There are in general 3 classes of urate-lowering agents: 1) *****************************Xanthine Oxidase inhibitors,***************************** 2) *****************Uricosuric agents*****************, 3) ******************Uricolytic agents.******************
- Urate-lowering agents are mainly used for the **************long-term management of gout (Management of chronic tophaceous gout, or intercritical gout)**************, and **************************************never used in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis**************************************, as [[Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares]].
- Xanthine oxidase inhibitors
- ****************************Examples of Xanthine oxidase inhibitors****************************
	- Allopurinol, febuxostat
- **************************************************************************************************************************MOA of Xanthine oxidase inhibitors**************************************************************************************************************************
	- Xanthine oxidase works by decreasing uric acid synthesis.
	- Allopurinol is activated into alloxanthine by xanthine oxidase.
	- Alloxanthine in turn non-competitively inhibits xanthine oxidase, thus inhibiting the conversion of Hypoxanthines into xanthines and eventually into uric acids.
	- ![[Untitled]]
	- This results in **decreased uric acid synthesis**, and **increase in serum xanthine levels**, which is more soluble.
	- Febuxostat directly inhibits xanthine oxidase.
- ********************************************************************************************Adverse effects of Xanthine oxidase inhibitors********************************************************************************************
	- 1. Xanthine stones (Nephrothialisis)
		- Inhibition of xanthine oxidase results in elevation of serum xanthine levels, and an increase in xanthine concentration in urine, which can cause xanthine stones.
		- This is avoided by drinking large volumes of water, maintaining a high daily urine output of >2L, resulting in a lower concentration of xanthine in urine.
		- A high urine pH (> pH 6) by taking sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate can also prevent the formation of xanthine stones.
	- 2. [[Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares]].
	- For Allopurinol (**********************************which is generally well tolerated**********************************):
	- Gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, vommiting, diarrhoea)
	- Hypersensitivity reactions (with increased risk of **Steven-Johnson syndrome**)
		- This normally limited to the first 2 months of therapy.
		- It is associated with the HLA-B*5801 allele, with high prevalence in Southeast Asian and African American, *HLA screening is indicated before initiating allopurinol therapy.*
	- Allopurinol is contraindicated in nursing mothers and children, except those with malignancy or genetic defects of purine metabolism.
	- Dose adjustment is required for those with renal insufficiency (as it is excreted by renal mechanisms.
	- For Febuxostat:
	- Liver function abnormalities
		- Hence, periodic monitoring of liver functions is required.
	- Nausea, joint pain and rash
	- Febuxostat is associated with increased risk of ****************myocardial infarction**************** and *******stroke*******
		- Hence, periodic monitoring of cardiovascular risk is required.
- Uricosuric agents
- **Examples of Uricosuric agents**
	- Probenecid (most commonly used), Benzbromarone, lesinurad
- ************************************MOA of Uricosuric agents************************************
	- Uricosuric agents work by increasing renal excretion of uric acid.
	- Uricosuric agents inhibit reabsorption of uric acid via Uric acid transporter 1 (UAT1), a member of the organic anion transporter, at the proximal convoluted tubule.
	- This results in increased concentration of uric acid in the filtrate, resulting in ******************************************************************************************************increased renal excretion of uric acid******************************************************************************************************.
	- This results in a decrease in serum uric acid levels.
- ****************************************************************Precautions of Uricosuric agents****************************************************************
	- Uricosuric agents have many drug interactions:
	- Uricosuric agents inhibit the ******urate-anion exchanger system******, thus also inhibiting the tubular secretions of organic anionic drugs.
		- This results in elevation of the plasma drug levels.
		- e.g [[Penicillin]], methotrexate, glucuronide metabolites of NSAID.
	- [[Salicylate]] NSAIDS inhibit the action of uricosuric agents. [[EditLater]]
	- Uricosuric agents are avoided in patients with ***************overproduction*************** of uric acid, as concentration of uric acid in filtrate is already high, and can precipitate urate stones.
	- Uricosuric agents are also avoided in patients with nephrolithiasis.
	- Uricosuric agents are avoided in patients with renal insufficiency (except benzbromarone).
- ************************************************************************Adverse effects of Uricosuric agents************************************************************************
	- 1. Urate stones (Nephrothialisis)
		- Inhibition of uric acid reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules will result in a high concentration of uric acid in urine, which will result in the formation of urate stones.
		- This is avoided by drinking large amounts of water, maintaining a high daily urine volume (>2L), resulting in a low concentration of uric acid in urine.
		- A high urine pH can also prevent the formation of urine stones.
	- 2. [[Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares]]
	- 3. Mild GI disturbance
	- 4. Overdose of probenecid can cause fatal outcomes like *****************************************************CNS stimulation, convulsions and respiratory failure.*****************************************************
		- As probenecid can cross the blood brain barrier.
- Uricolytic agents
- **********************************************************Examples of uricolytic agents**********************************************************
	- *Rasburicase** - A recombinant mammalian urate oxidase, with a short duration of action.
	- *Pegloticase** - A recombinant mammalian urate oxidase that is conjugated to methoxypolyethylene glycol to prolong circulating half life (duration of action) and diminish immunogenicity.
- ************MOA of uricolytic agents************
	- Uricolytic agents are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of the poorly soluble uric acid to the more soluble allatoin.
	- This results in a decrease in serum uric acid levels.
- **************************************************************Precaution of uricolytic agents**************************************************************
	- Uricolytic agents are avoided in G6PD deficiency:
	- Uricase activity also results in formation of hydrogen peroxide, which results in hemolytic anemia, and the risk of methemoglobinemia.
- ********************************************************************Adverse effects of uricolytic agents********************************************************************
	- Severe allergic reactions
	- Infusion reactions
- ******************************************************************Clinical use of uricolytic agents******************************************************************
	- Uricolytic agents tend to have little role in the long-term management of gout:
	- Pegloticase is used when the patient is refractory to other urate-lowering agents.
	- Rasburicase is seldom use for management of gout due to its short duration of action.
	- Rasburicase is used for treating transient hyperuricaemia, after chemotherapy, to avoid tumour lysis syndrome.
