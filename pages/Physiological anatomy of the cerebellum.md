- Physiological anatomy of the cerebellum
- The cerebellum consists of the cerebellar cortex, deep white matter, and within the white matter, deep (subcortical) cerebellar nuclei.
- Cerebellar cortex
- [[The cerebellar cortex consists of granular layer, purkinje layer and molecular layer]].
- Deep cerebellar nuclei
- Medially, within the vermis, it consists of **fastigal nucleus**.
- Lateral, within the intermediate hemisphere, is the **globose nucleus** and the **emboliform nucleus**.
- Most laterally, within the lateral hemisphere, is the large **denate nucleus**.

- Physiological division of the cerebellum
- Physiological anatomy of the cerebellum divides the cerebellum mainly vertically ([[Cerebellum#Separation of the cerebellum in a vertical axis]]) giving rise to:
- The vestibulocerebellum
- The spinocerebellum
- The cerebrocerebellum
