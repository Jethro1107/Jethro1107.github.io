- ### Cerebrospinal fluid
  collapsed:: true
	- *Cerebrospinal fluid** is an ultrafiltrate of plasma produced from [[Choroid plexus]] of the [[Ventricular system]].
	- There is roughly 150ml of *clear, colourless* CSF in adults, 2/3 is present within the spine.
	- **Composition of CSF**
	  collapsed:: true
		- CSF is a clear and colourless fluid that has similar composition as plasma, but with:
		- Minimal protein
		- 2/3 of glucose in blood
		- No red blood cells
		- Little white blood cells (<5/mm3)
		- Less Ca2+ and K+
		- More Cl-
		- An increase in protein and decrease in glucose contents in CSF may indicate a bacterial CNS infection/ meningitis.
	- **Functions of CSF**

	  collapsed:: true
		- 1. **Bouyancy** - CSF provides mechanical bouyancy and support for the brain
		- 2. **Protection** - CSF serves as a shock absorber/ cushion to protect the [[Central nervous system]] from trauma
		- 3. **Homeostasis** - CSF maintains a stable physical and biochemical environment
		- 4. **Removal of metabolic waste** - Metabolic wastes produced by neurons drains from glymphatics into CSF, which then returns to blood via the [[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway]].
