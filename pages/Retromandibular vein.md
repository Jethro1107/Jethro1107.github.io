- # Retromandibular vein
	- The retromandibular vein is formed from the *union of the maxillary vein, and superficial temporal vein* in the substance of the parotid glands, and descends along the ramus of the [[Mandible]] to its angle.
	- At the angle, it divides into the anterior branch and a posterior branch:
		- The anterior branch joins the **fascial vein** to form the **common fascial vein**, one of the tributaries of the [[Internal jugular vein]].
		- The posterior branch joins with the **posterior auricular vein** to give the [[Superficial veins of the neck|External jugular vein]].
