- Biochemistry of bone and cartilage
- The biochemistry of the extracellular matrix determines its mechanical properties and function (Form determines Function).
- Biochemistry of bone
- The extracellular matrix of [[Bone tissue]] is highly specialised, called the [[Bone matrix]], consist of mineralized osteoid, acquired through the [[Biomineralization of bone]].
- Biochemistry of cartilage
- The extracellular matrix of articular cartilage is called the [[Cartilage matrix]]. You would expect the composition of cartilage matrix to differ from the bone matrix becomes they are required to perform different functions. An important features of cartilage matrix is the [[Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans]], which gives it its compressive resistance.
- *************************************************Degeneration of cartilage**************************************************
- Degenerative changes of cartilage underlies many diseases:
- [[Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)]]]]
- Compression disorders - [[Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation]].
