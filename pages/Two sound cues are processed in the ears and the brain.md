- ### Two sound cues are processed in the ear and the brain
  collapsed:: true
	- Two sound cues are processed in the ear and the brain:
		- Tone
		- Intensity (loudness)
	- These correspond to the **frequency** and the **amplitude** of a sound wave.
	- The location of sound is processed centrally by comparing the intensity and binaural time delay between the left and the right ear.
