- # Pons
  collapsed:: true
	- The pons is the middle structure of the [[Brainstem]].
	- ### Surface anatomy of the Pons
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Anterior features**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Anteriorly, the pons is characterised by the **trigeminal nerve**.
			- The basillary sulcus is also present, in association with [Basillar artery](((63bd7db3-9b21-4a32-8a97-d32b7e8a90e6))) .
		- **Posterior features**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Posteriorly, the pons is characterised by the **superior cerebellar peduncle** and the **middle cerebellar peduncle**.
		- The pons forms parts of the floor of the 4th ventricle. [[The rhomboid fossa bears various features that reveals the internal structure of the medulla and pons]].
	- ### Internal structures of the Pons
	  collapsed:: true
		- The pons is divided into a ventral side (basal side) and a dorsal side (tegmental side), which is divided by the dorsally displaced, horizontally arranged medial lamniscus.
		- **Basal part of the pons**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The pontine nucleus is present in the ventral part of the pons. Many fibres pass through the pontine nucleus:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Dorsally, the transversely arranged **pontocerebellar fibres** are found.
				- Ventrally, the descending **corticospinal tract** is found.
		- **Tegmental part of the pons**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The tegmental part of the pons is characterised by various cranial nerve nuclei.
			  collapsed:: true
				- In the lower pons, the fascial nucleus is located laterally and the abducens nucleus is located medially.
				- In the upper pons, the trochlear nucleus is located medially.
		- **Descending pathways**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Ventrally, patchy bundles of corticospinal tract descend through the pontine trigeminal nucleus of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]].
		- **Ascending pathways**
		  collapsed:: true
			- [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]] - The medial lamniscus ascends dorsally, in a horizontal plane.
		- **Cranial nerve nuclei**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Ventrally, the pontine nucleus is present.
			- At the lower pons, the nucleus of the fascial nerve is located laterally, and the abducens nucleus is located medially.
			- At the upper pons, the trochlear nucleus is located medially.
