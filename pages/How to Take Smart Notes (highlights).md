- What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.[1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. They seem to forget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development.

- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975).
  
  [Location: 195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=195)
- Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement ‚Äì which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated?

- People still search for Luhmann‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret,‚Äù putting down his remarkable output to him being a genius or even thinking they only need his slip-box and they would be set. Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don‚Äôt have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can‚Äôt be compensated by a high IQ.
  
  [Location: 387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=387)
- Strictly speaking, Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read.
  
  [Location: 416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=416)
- Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.
  
  [Location: 419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=419)
- In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box.

  The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers.
  
  [Location: 435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=435)
- it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique.
  
  [Location: 444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=444)
- Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done.
  
  [Location: 485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=485)
- Granted, writing these notes is the main work. It will take enormous amounts of effort, time, patience and willpower, and you will probably break under the weight of this task. Just kidding. It is the easiest part of all. Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.

- Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.

- ‚ÄúNotes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,‚Äù neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes in the introduction to the Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics, summarizing decades of research.
  
  [Location: 498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=498)
- This is something I forget often, which reduces resurfacibility
  
  [Location: 538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=538)
- See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about. Take more notes, develop ideas further and see where things will take you.
  
  [Location: 539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=539)
- In reality, you never work on just one idea, but many ideas in different stages at the same time. And that is where the system plays out its real strengths. We cannot help but think about more than one question at a time and the chances are that you will think and write in the future as well. It might not be for academia or a publication, but certainly for your own intellectual growth.

- Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. Nobody starts from scratch and everybody is already able to think for themselves. Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia.

- Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). If you change your mind about the importance of writing, you will also change your mind about everything else. Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.
  
  [Location: 737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=737)
- Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminars and semester. From the perspective of someone who writes, that makes as much sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they were bought from. Can‚Äôt find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store.
  
  [Location: 788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=788)
- The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.
  
  [Location: 797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=797)
- The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight.
  
  [Location: 818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=818)
- Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later.
  
  [Location: 844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844)
- Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.
  
  [Location: 848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848)
- The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box. The former can be very brief as the context is clearly the text they refer to.
  
  [Location: 854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=854)
- In order to develop a good question to write about or find the best angle for an assignment, one must already have put some thought into a topic. To be able to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic. And the decision to read something and not

- A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on.
  
  [Location: 991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=991)
- Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. Dweck shows convincingly that the most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a ‚Äúgrowth mindset.‚Äù
  
  [Location: 1009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1009)
- Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding).
  
  [Location: 1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1016)
- Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation. Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important. Being open for feedback doesn‚Äôt help very much if the only feedback you can get comes once every few months for work you have already finished.
  
  [Location: 1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1021)
- The ability to express understanding in one‚Äôs own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes ‚Äì and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. But the better we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which again increases the number of learning experiences.
  
  [Location: 1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1036)
- The same goes for writing permanent notes, which have another feedback loop built-in: Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions.

  And the best thing about this is that while we learn and become better, our slip-box becomes more knowledgeable too. It grows and improves. And the more it grows, the more useful it becomes and the easier it will be for us to make new connections.
  
  [Location: 1045](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1045)
- The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less about retrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight by letting ideas mingle. Its usability grows with its size, not just linearly but exponentially.
  
  [Location: 1048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1048)
- It is not the slip-box or our brains alone, but the dynamic between them that makes working with it so productive.
  
  [Location: 1063](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1063)
- Psychologists who interviewed the multitaskers did test them instead of just asking. They gave them different tasks to accomplish and compared their results with another group that was instructed to do only one thing at a time. The outcome is unambiguous: While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased ‚Äì a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). Not only the quantity but also the quality of their accomplishments lagged significantly behind that of the control group.
  
  [Location: 1093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1093)
- When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task.
  
  [Location: 1102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1102)
- The slip-box provides not only a clear structure to work in, but also forces us to shift our attention consciously as we can complete tasks in reasonable time before moving on to the next one. Together with the fact that every task is accompanied by writing, which in itself requires undistracted attention, the slip-box can become a haven for our restless minds.
  
  [Location: 1131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1131)
- Oshin Vartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. ‚ÄúSpecifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.‚Äù (Vartanian 2009, 57)
  
  [Location: 1179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1179)
- What psychologists do not discuss, though, are the external conditions that allow us to be flexible in the first place. The mental flexibility to be extremely focused for one moment and playfully explore ideas in the next is just one side of the equation. To be flexible, we need an equally flexible work structure that doesn‚Äôt break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan.
  
  [Location: 1187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1187)
- To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn.
  
  [Location: 1217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1217)
- Here, gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience. It is the sedimentation of deeply learned practice through numerous feedback loops on success or failure.[20]
  
  [Location: 1242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1242)
- psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956).
  
  [Location: 1263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1263)
- And deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about. Every step is accompanied by questions like: How does this fact fit into my idea of ‚Ä¶? How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other? Isn‚Äôt this argument similar to that one? Haven‚Äôt I heard this before? And above all: What does x mean for y? These questions not only increase our understanding, but facilitate learning as well. Once we make a meaningful connection to an idea or fact, it is difficult not to remember it when we think about what it is connected with.
  
  [Location: 1283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1283)
- Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. We can ruminate about them, even when we do something that has nothing to do with work and ideally does not require our full attention. Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way.
  
  [Location: 1318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1318)
- You need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. But don‚Äôt turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.
  
  [Location: 1431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1431)
- The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually not even aware of this confirmation bias (or myside bias[28]) that surreptitiously meddles with our life. Somehow, we just seem to happen to be surrounded by people who all think alike. (Not on purpose, of course. We just spend our time with people we like. And why do we like them? Correct: Because they think like us.) We just seem to happen to read the publications that tend to confirm what we already know. (Not on purpose, of course. We just try to stick with good, intelligent texts. And what makes us think these texts are good and intelligent? Correct: because they make sense to us.)
  
  That‚Äôs why we should not pick out a topic before doing research, as we will be subjected to confirmation bias, only finding supporting arguments and dismissing contradicting ones.
  
  [Location: 1459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1459)
- The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant.
  
  You are more likely to search for arguments that support your hypothesis, despite it being based on a hunch
  
  [Location: 1484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1484)
- Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight.
  
  [Location: 1490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1490)
- We postpone the decision on what to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass within the slip-box. Instead of having the hypothesis in mind all the time, we want to: ¬† ¬∑¬†¬†¬† Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read, ¬∑¬†¬†¬† Make sure we have given a true account of its content ¬∑¬†¬†¬† Find the relevance of it and make connections. ¬† Only then do we take a step back to look at what developed, then make a decision on what conclusions are to be drawn from that.
  
  [Location: 1492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1492)
- The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections.
  
  [Location: 1502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1502)
- One of the most important habitual changes when starting to work with the slip-box is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the open connections within the slip-box.
  
  [Location: 1506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1506)
- Extracting the gist of a text or an idea and giving an account in writing is for academics what daily practice on the piano is for pianists: The more often we do it and the more focused we are, the more virtuous we become.
  
  Knowledge workers should approach virtuosity as athletes and musicians
  
  [Location: 1526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1526)
- Physicist and Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it. Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture.
  
  Writing permanent notes may be the best way to confront whether we truly understand the concept
  
  [Location: 1570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1570)
- ‚ÄúThe principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool,‚Äù Feynman stressed in a speech to young scientists (Feynman 1985, 342). Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more (Bornstein 1989).
  
  Exposure effect: thinking you are better due to repetitive practice Hence, rereading does not improve understanding, only writing can
  
  [Location: 1581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1581)
- It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere re-viewing (Stein et al. 1984)
  
  [Location: 1648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1648)
- But there is a caveat. Even though elaboration works verifiably well for deep understanding, it might not be the best choice if you just want to learn isolated encyclopaedic facts (Rivard 1994). But as long as you are not striving for a career as a quiz show candidate, why would you want that, anyway? The slip-box takes care of storing facts and information. Thinking and understanding is what it can‚Äôt take off your shoulders, which is why it makes sense to focus on this part of the work.
  
  [Location: 1652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1652)
- As a medical student, this is wrong as there are many facts that I should remember, but forcing myself to learn by elaboration May promote deeper understanding as it would help me confront the weak links in my knowledge. it may also result in me asking more follow-up questions, which is something that I admittedly struggle with, but would help me reinforce my learning
  
  [Location: 1669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1669)
- Luhmann managed to beat Trollope in productivity if you count his articles as well as his books. Luhmann wrote 58 books and hundreds of articles, while Trollope wrote 47 novels plus 16 other books. Granted, it might have something to do with the fact that Luhmann did some work after breakfast as well. But the main reason is the slip-box, which compares to Trollope‚Äôs technique as investing with compounded interest compares to a piggy-bank. Trollope is like a diligent saver who puts a little sum to the side every day, which adds up over time toward something impressive. Three dollars put aside each day (say, one takeout coffee) add up over the year to a small vacation ($1,000) and over a working life to a deposit on a flat as a permanent holiday retreat.[31] Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest (which would in this example almost pay for the whole flat).[32]
  
  Trollope set aside time to write before breakfast, writing a couple pages of his novel everyday. In a sense, his commitment to writing fares with Luhmann‚Äôs. But Luhmann was able to be more productive due to the way he writes, i.e. his note taking system.
  
  [Location: 1710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1710)
- In contrast to manuscript pages per day, a certain number of notes a day is a reasonable goal for academic writing.
  
  The better way for breaking down tasks in academic writing and learning
  
  [Location: 1725](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1725)
- You could therefore measure your daily productivity by the number of notes written.
  
  The quality of my work days often correlates to the number of notes I was able to make
  
  [Location: 1727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1727)
- As we write notes with an eye towards existing notes, we take more into account than the information that is already available in our internal memory. That is extremely important, because the internal memory retrieves information not in a rational or logical way, but according to psycho-logical rules. The brain also doesn‚Äôt store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information.

  Philosophers, neuroscientists, educators and psychologists like to disagree in many different aspects on how the brain works. But they no longer disagree when it comes to the need for external scaffolding. Almost all agree nowadays that real thinking requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing. ‚ÄúNotes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible‚Äù is one of the key takeaways in a contemporary handbook of neuroscientists (Levy 2011, 290) Concluding the discussions in this book, Levy writes: ‚ÄúIn any case, no matter how internal processes are implemented, insofar as thinkers are genuinely concerned with what enables human beings to perform the spectacular intellectual feats exhibited in science and other areas of systematic enquiry, as well as in the arts, they need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.‚Äù (Ibid.)

- I took some literature notes collecting reasons how and why humans act so very differently when they experience scarcity. This was step one, done with an eye towards the argument of the book. I had questions in mind like: Is this convincing? What methods do they use? Which of the references are familiar? But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?
  
  Lit note vs perm note: an eye to the authors idea and an eye to existing notes
  
  [Location: 1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1780)
- The literature notes are going to be archived, which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn‚Äôt do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas.
  
  [Location: 1817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1817)
- Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings.

- Remembering is the very mechanism to bring a memory back into our conscious mind.
  
  [Location: 1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1856)
- If we instead focus on ‚Äúretrieval strength,‚Äù we instantly start to think strategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory. There are no natural cues: Every piece of information can become the trigger for another piece of information.
  
  When neurons fire together, they wire together. It is essential for us to associate one information with many other pieces of information, such that any reminder of the associated information would trigger the retrieval of the original information.So why am I not retrieving information better than those relying solely on anki for their studies?

- Making these connections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other.

- Stein et al. illustrate how commonsensical this is on the example of a biology novice who learns the difference between veins and arteries: ‚Äú[he] may find it difficult at first to understand and remember that arteries have thick walls, are elastic, and do not have valves, whereas veins are less elastic, have thinner walls, and have valves‚Äù (ibid.). But by elaborating a little bit on this difference and asking the right questions, like ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù the students can connect this knowledge with prior knowledge, like their understanding of pressure and the function of the heart. Just by making the connection to the common knowledge that the heart presses the blood into the arteries, they immediately know that these walls need to sustain more pressure, which means they need to be thicker than veins, in which the blood flows back to the heart with less pressure. And, of course, this makes valves necessary to keep the blood from flowing back. Once understood, the attributes and differences are almost impossible to disentangle from the knowledge of veins and arteries.

- 11.4 ¬† Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip-Box
  
  Reread to understand creation of permanent notes
  
  [Location: 1952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1952)
- Most notes will be found through other notes. The organisation of the notes is in the network of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are entry points. A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point. The quicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move our attention from mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level of interconnected content, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with the slip-box.
  
  Function of index: provide entry points into the slipbox, i.e. different doors into the slipbox. It identifies the potential points where new permanent notes could be placed, or brings you in the vicinity of the areaFunction of links and backlinks: Provides a strong scaffolding for the slipbox, allowing you to easily think in the slipbox, jumping from notes to notes and forming new connections

- The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.
  
  Good keywords enhance resurfability of notes Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation.

- Only the first and last are relevant for the digital Zettelkasten, the other two are merely compensating for restrictions of the analogue pen and paper version. You don‚Äôt need to concern yourself with them if you use the digital program.
  
  The two links are:1. Links to indexes2. Micro-links between individual notesLuhmann‚Äôs notetaking method also include the last entry point and next entry point, i.e. the notes that comes before and after this note, which is built into Zettlekasten application
  
  [Location: 2062](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2062)
- The constant comparing of notes also serves as an ongoing examination of old notes in a new light.
  
  [Location: 2132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2132)
- Adding new notes to old notes and being forced to compare them leads not only to a constant improvement of one‚Äôs own work, but often discloses weaknesses in the texts we read.
  
  [Location: 2136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2136)
- The slip-box not only confronts us with dis-confirming information, but also helps with what is known as the feature-positive effect (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones. Without external help, we would not only take exclusively into account what we know, but what is on top of our heads.[35] The slip-box constantly reminds us of information we have long forgotten and wouldn‚Äôt remember otherwise ‚Äì so much so, we wouldn‚Äôt even look for it.

- Note after 1st read: Built in spaced repetition‚Ä¶ kind ofNote after 2nd read: Wow, I‚Äôve already encountered the idea of space repetition approximation when working with a zettlekasten before reading Andy‚Äôs notes on here. This is why I should read deeply and take literature notes.
  
  [Location: 2151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2151)
- A scientific term or concept only becomes meaningful within the context of a theory ‚Äì otherwise it would just be a word.
  
  [Location: 2155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2155)
- The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head. Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached to one or two and see only what fits them. You would become the man with a hammer who sees nails everywhere (cf. Maslow, 1966, 15).
  
  to have an abundance of mental frameworks at our disposal is to have the ability to correlate a concept to the correct framework. Otherwise, one would try to manipulate the concepts that would alter the core meaning, just to fit it in a mental model in an inorganic way
  
  [Location: 2167](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2167)
- You‚Äôve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.‚Äù (Munger 1994).
  
  [Location: 2173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2173)
- The beauty of this approach is that we co-evolve with our slip-boxes: we build the same connections in our heads while we deliberately develop them in our slip-box ‚Äì and make it easier to remember the facts as they now have a latticework we can attach them to. If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.
  
  [Location: 2182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2182)
- We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval). The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it.

- Even sudden breakthroughs are usually preceded by a long, intense process of preparation.

- (Johnson 2011).
  
  [Location: 2234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2234)
- To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification. We did this when we took literature notes and translated them into the different contexts within the slip-box. Abstraction does not have a good reputation at the moment. It is the tangible, the concrete that is cheered for. Abstraction should indeed not be the final goal of thinking, but it is a necessary in-between step to make heterogeneous ideas compatible. If Darwin had never abstracted from his concrete observations of sparrows, he would never have found an abstract, a general principle of evolution across different species, and he would never have been able to see how evolution works in other species as well.
  
  [Location: 2256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2256)
- Being able to abstract and re-specify ideas is, again, only one side of the equation. It is not good for anything if we don‚Äôt have a system in place that allows us to put this into practice. Here, it is the concrete standardization of notes in just one format that enables us to literally shuffle them around, to add one idea to multiple contexts and to compare and combine them in a creative way without losing sight of what they truly contain.
  
  Good note structure is essential for seemless context shifting and thus allows us to make better links between notes
  
  [Location: 2273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2273)
- Standardised is also the way we treat literature and our own thoughts: Instead of using different kinds of notes or techniques for different kinds of texts or ideas, the approach here is always the same, simple one. Literature is condensed on a note saying, ‚ÄúOn page x, it says y,‚Äù and later stored with the reference in one place. Ideas and thoughts are captured on the slip-box notes and connected to other notes always in the same way in the same place.

- ‚ÄúThe Paradox of Choice,‚Äù
  
  [Location: 2383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2383)
- The formal standardization of the slip-box might seem to be at odds with our search for creativity. But here, too, it is more likely the opposite is true. Thinking and creativity can flourish under restricted conditions and there are plenty of studies to back that claim (cf. Stokes 2001; Rheinberger 1997). The scientific revolution started with the standardization and controlling of experiments, which made them comparable and repeatable (cf. Shapin, 1996).
  
  [Location: 2387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2387)
- The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. Without restrictions, we would never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing and what is not. Indifference is the worst environment for insight.
  
  [Location: 2403](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2403)
- The process is self-reinforcing. A visibly developed cluster attracts more ideas and provides more possible connections, which in return influence our choices on what to read and think further. They become signposts for our daily work and orient us to what is worth thinking about. Topics grow bottom up and gain traction along the way. As soon as the slip-box has grown a bit, we can replace our thoughts on what is interesting and what we think is relevant with a pragmatic look into the slip-box, where we can plainly see what truly proved to be interesting and where we found material to work with.
  
  [Location: 2461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2461)
- One of the most difficult tasks is to rigorously delete what has no function within an argument ‚Äì ‚Äúkill your darlings.‚Äù[42] This becomes much easier when you move the questionable passages into another document and tell yourself you might use them later. For every document I write, I have another called ‚Äúxy-rest.doc,‚Äù and every single time I cut something, I copy it into the other document, convincing myself that I will later look through it and add it back where it might fit. Of course, it never happens ‚Äì but it still works. Others who know a thing or two about psychology do the same (cf. Thaler, 2015, 81f).
  
  [Location: 2648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2648)
- The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects.
