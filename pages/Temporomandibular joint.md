- ### Temporomandibular joint
  collapsed:: true
	- The temporomandibular joint is the articulation between the glenoid process on the inferior surface of the [[Temporal bone]], and the head of the condylar process of the [[Mandible]].
	- **Classification of temporomandibular joint**
	  collapsed:: true
		- It is characterised as a synovial joint.
		- But unlike other synovial joint, the articular surface is lined by fibrocartilage instead of hyaline cartilage.
		- In terms of classification by movement:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Some consider it as a modified hinge joint, some consider it as a condylar joint.
			- Some even go as far as to calling it a ball and socket joint.
			- This generally doesn't matter, as all we should know is the extent of movement.
	- **Joint capsule of the temporomandibular joint**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The joint capsule is quite laxed anteriorly (predisposing to dislocation).
	- **Movements of the temporomandibular joint**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The temporomandibular joint enables:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Elevation and depression
			- **Protraction and retraction**, where the head of the mandible moves forwards to the articular tubercle, and back into the mandibular fossa.
			- Side to side movement (medially and laterally)
	- Within the joint capsule, the intra-articular disc separates the joint space into the upper and lower chambers.
	  collapsed:: true
		- The upper part is responsible for **protrusion and retraction**.
		- The lower part is responsible for hinge movements, i.e. **elevation and depression**.
