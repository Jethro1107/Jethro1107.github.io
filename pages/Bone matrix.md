- Bone matrix
- Bone matrix is a mixed matrix consisting of organic matrix (osteoid) synthesized by [[Osteoblast]]s and inorganic matrix that is formed from the [[Biomineralization of bone]], also regulated by [[Osteoblast]]s.
- Components of organic matrix (30% of bone matrix)
- The organic matrix consist of 90% **type 1 collagen** ([[Collagen synthesis]]) which provides tensile strength to the bone matrix, but is also important in the biomineralization of bone.
- Glucosaminoglycans, e.g. Decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin and hyaluronan is present, but has little contributions to the mechanical functions of bone.
- Glycoproteins, notably, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein, are present to regulate [[Biomineralization of bone]].
- Components of inorganic matrix (70% of bone matrix)
- The inorganic matrix mainly consist of **calcium hydroxyapatite crystals**, *acquired through the biomineralisation of bone*.
