- Lateral rotators of the hip joint
	 - Piriformis
id:: 6442079f-7f26-4ae4-bf41-ac30702eaa84
		 - The piriformis originates from the anterior sciatic foramina and leaves the pelvic cavity via the greater sciatic foramen. It then inserts onto posterior surface of the greater tubercle of the humerus.

- [[Gastronemius]]

- [[Sacral plexus]]
	 - [[Sural nerve]]

	 - [[Common peroneal nerve]]
		 - Just above the [[Popliteal fossa]], the [[Sciatic nerve]] branches into the common peroneal nerve.

		 - The common peroneal nerve is formed by the posterior divisions of the anterior rami of L4 to S3.

		 - The common peroneal nerve descends laterally, against the medial border of the [[Biceps femoris]].

		 - As the common peroneal nerve emerges from the [[Popliteal fossa]], it winds around the neck of the femur, as it branches into the [[Superficial fibular nerve]] and the [[Deep fibular nerve]].

		 - [[Superficial fibular nerve]]
			 - The superficial fibular nerve is a branch of the [[Common peroneal nerve]] that descends deep to the muscles of the [[Lateral compartment of the leg]].

			 - The superficial fibular nerve supplies the muscles of the [[Lateral compartment of the leg]], i.e. the ((2ce566a6-e3ce-48ca-a9ab-28252fadf26c)) and ((ddaae365-6b72-4037-8791-d2671f476fda))

		 - [[Deep fibular nerve]]
			 - The deep fibular nerve is a branch of the [[Common peroneal nerve]] that passes anteromedially and pierces through the anterior intermuscular septum into the [[Anterior compartment of the leg]], where it passes deep to the ((980e7d82-012c-4914-83c7-5b53596a6bfa)).

			 - The deep fibular nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg.
