- # Nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses
	- The head region houses many compartments:
		- The 2 orbits, the 2 nasal cavities and an oral cavity
	- Bony framework of the nasal cavity: The nose skeleton
		- The nasal cavity serves as as the most proximal part of the respiratory tract.
		- It opens anteriorly as the anterior nasal aperture (nostrils), while it opens posteriorly to the nasopharynx as the posterior nasal aperture (chonae)
- [[Relevant Notes]] [[External skeleton]]
	- [[Permanent Notes]] [[The external nose skeleton forms the anterior part of the nasal cavity]]
		- [[Fleeting Notes]]
			- Superiorly, the paired nasal bone, which meets the frontal bone at a point called the nasion
			- Inferiorly, marked by the setal cartilage, forming the anterior part of the nasal septum, dividing the two nasal cavities anteriorly
			- The lateral process of the septal cartilage, a major alar cartilage inferiorly, and 3-4 minor alar cartilage help define the external framework of the nasal cavities.
			- Alar fibrofatty tissue is found laterally of the nares

	  collapsed:: true
		- [[Fleeting Notes]] The two nasal cavities is divded by the **Nasal septum**, formed by various cartilage and bones.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Something to note is that the *nasal cavity forms the medial wall of the nasal cavity*
			- Anteriorly, as mentioned, it is formed by the septal cartilage
			- Posteriorly, it is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, superiorly, and the vomer inferiorly.
- [[Permanent Notes]] [[Bony framework of the roof, floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity]]
	- [[Fleeting Notes]] Different bones of the cranium helps define the bony framework of the nasal cavity.
		- **Floor of the nasal cavity**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The floor of the nasal cavity is smooth, concave, and much wider than the roof of the nasal cavity
				- Contributed by the superior surface of the hard palate
					- The hard palate consists of the palatine process of the maxilla, and the horizontal plate of the palatine bone.
		- **Roof of the nasal cavity**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The roof of the nasal cavity is much narrower than the floor
				- Much of the roof is marked by the cribiform plate of the ethmoid bone
				- Anteriorly, the nasal crest of the frontal bone, nasal bone, and contributions from the lateral processes of the septal cartilage
				- aposterior to the ethmoid bone, is is marked by the body of the sphenoid bone, ala of vomer, and sphenoidal process of palatine bone, and the vaginal process of the medial pterygoid plate
		- **Lateral wall of nasal cavity**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The lateral wall of nasal cavity is characterised by three shelf-like structures: The nasal conchae (turbinate), which gives rise to meatus underneath.
			- The bony framework:
				- Superiorly, marked by the ethmoid labirynth, superior conchae, and middle conchae
				- Inferiorly, marked by the inferior conchae
				- Posteriorly, the perpendicular plate of palatine (anteriorly) and the medial pterygoid plate of sphenoid bone posteriorly
				- Anteriorly, the medial surface of the lacrimal bone and maxilla
- **Much of the nasal cavity is lined with the respiratory mucosa with respiratory epithelium**

	- [[Permanent Notes]] [[Paranasal sinuses]]
		- [[Fleeting Notes]]
			- There are 4 paranasal air sinuses named corresponding to the respective bones where they are found. They are the frontal sinus, ethmoid cell, sphenoid sinus, and the maxillary sinus
			- Frontal sinus
				- Roughly triangular paranasal sinus that is found in the frontal bone
				- Drains through the lateral wall via the frontonasal duct, which penatrate the ethmoid labyrinth, and continues as the ethmoidal infundibulum at the front end of the semilunar hiatus
			- Ethmoid cell is located within the ethmoid labyrinth as individual cells, that is divided into the anterior, middle and posterior ethmoid cells
				- The anterior ethmoid cells opening into the ethmoid infundibulum or frontonasal duct
				- The middle ethmoid cell opens into the ethmoid bulla
				- Posterior ethmoid cells open into the superior meatus
			- Maxillary sinus
				- Found in the maxilla, the largest paranasal air sinus
				- Opens into the floor of semilunar hiatus (which is found in the middle meatus)
			- Sphenoid sinus
				- Found on either side of the body of sphenoid bone
				- Drains through apertures on the posterior wall of the sphenoethmoidal recess
			- Innervation
				- The paranasal sinus is innervated by branches of the trigeminal n. particularly v1 and v2
			- Blood supply
				- Branches of opthalmic artery
				- Branches of maxillary artery
