  collapsed:: true
	- ### Psychosis and its symptoms
	  collapsed:: true
		- A mental disorder characterised by delusion, hallucination and disorganised speech.
		- Use of antipsychotics early enough allows for avoiding irreversible damage.
		- Mental disorders are in general treated by two types of drugs: Antidepressants and antipsychotics.
		  collapsed:: true
			- Antidepressants target monoamine hypothesis.
			- Antipsychotics blocks dopamine action, a chemical controlling reward driven learning.
		- Symptoms of psychosis
		  collapsed:: true
			- Hallucinations that occur in all five sense - perceive something that is not consistent with relality
			- Dellusion, when a person believes things that when examined rationally, are not true.
			  collapsed:: true
				- My notes: so hallucination changes ones perception of reality, delusion changes their entire believe system?
			- Confused and disturbed thoughts
			  collapsed:: true
				- Their speech may be rapid and constant
				- Content is random, context switching rapidly
				- Train of though may suddenly stop
				- Make strange thought, or strange connections of thought
			- A lack of insight and self awareness
			  collapsed:: true
				- rarely seek help as they perceive themselves as normals
			- Catatonia
			  collapsed:: true
				- Unresponsive, unable to focus and concentrate
		- A local research states that on average, 1.5 years after onset of symptom:
		- Not fast enough to prompt early treatment that is associated with better outcome.
	- ### Causes of psychosis
	  collapsed:: true
		- Psychological conditions
		  collapsed:: true
			- Schizophrenia - a condition defined by repeated episodes of psychosis
			- Bipolar - mood swings from one extreme to another (from depression to manic)
			- Stress or anxiety
			- Depression
			- Lack of sleep
		- General medical conditions
		  collapsed:: true
			- Many metabolic disorders and brain diseases
			- Two better known examples : B12 deficiency (MOA unknown, unclear how it causes psychosis) and stroke (rare, only 1% of post-stroke patients)
		- Substances
		  collapsed:: true
			- Alcohol and drugs
			- Cannabis increases dopamine in brain
			- Cocaine also by a similar
		- Others: Genetics. brain structural changes, hormones
	- ### Epidemiology
	  collapsed:: true
		- Quite common
		- 200k patients in Hong Kong, 1300 new cases received by HA annually
		- 1% of people may have 1 episode in their live
		- More common than T1DM
		- Usually develop in older teens (15yo) and early adulthood.
	- ### Management
	  collapsed:: true
		- Antipsychotics
		- Talk therapy
		- Social support and family therapy is also important
	- ### Typical Anti-psychotics and dopamine hypothesis
	  collapsed:: true
		- Administrative route:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Oral
			- Injections
		- Slow releasing:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Injection every 2-6 weeks
		- Rapid disintegrating formations:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Some psychotic patients
			- Dissolve rapidly in saliva as to avoid non-compliance
		- Classification Typical and atypical
		  collapsed:: true
			- Typical: target D2 (very high affinity)
			  collapsed:: true
				- Effective against positive signs of psychosis, but not the negative signs
			- Atypical: targets 5-HT2 receptors
		- **Note that they do not cure underlying psychological conditions, merely alleviate symptoms of psychosis**
		- **Dopamine hypothesis in the role of psychosis**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Theory suggesting that excessive amount of dopamine is the essential link to the symptoms of psychosis.
			- It is associated with how we feel something is significant, important or interesting.
			- Excessive amounts distort functions such as memory, emotion, learning and self-awareness
			- Dopamine hypothesis made on observation:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Antipsychotics are dopamine antagonist
				- Dopamine agonists exacerbate psychosis
				- An increase in density of dopamine receptors in patients with schizophrenia
			- Not a perfect hypothesis: as not all respond well to typical anti-psychotics.
		- **MOA of dopamine receptors**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Dopamine receptors (D1 to D5) regulate different functions.
			- D2 is most concentrated, found in cortex, corpus striatum, limbic system, basal ganglia, pituitary gland and hypothalamus.
			- Its MOA can be explained by:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Blocks mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways can alleviate psychotic symptoms, for these regions regulate memory, emotion, motivation, reward and desire.
			- Its adverse effects can be explained by:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Blocking of nigrostriatal pathway affects motor control (causes development of Parkinsons).
				- Blocking of tuberoinfundibular pathway affects hormonal regulation.
		- **Side effects of typical anti-psychotics**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Blockade of D2 receptors in other regions of the brain explains its adverse effects
			  collapsed:: true
				- Blockade of nigrostriatal region
				  collapsed:: true
					- Part of the extrapyramidal system that contribute to overall motor control
				- Blockade is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Acute dystonia
					- Akathisia
					- Parkinsonism
					- Tardive dyskinesia
				- These extrapyramidal symptoms tend to develop after years of antipsychotic therapy.
			- Blockade of tuberoinfundibular region
			  collapsed:: true
				- Hypothalamus-pituitary axis regulates hormonal regulation
				  collapsed:: true
					- Dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus inhibits the release of prolactin by the **anterior pituitary**.
				- Antipyschotic causes increased release of prolactin, hyperprolactinemia:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Effects on breasts (in men and women): Gynecomastia, galactorrhea (milk discharge)
					- Inhibits release of Gonadotropin hormone, thus inhibiting releasing FSH and LH, which impairs sexual functions and pregnancy.
			- Hence side effects include:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Extrapyramidal symptoms
				- Hyperprolactinemia symptoms
				- Drowsiness
			- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)
			  collapsed:: true
				- A rare side effect (1 in 500), but a medical emergency
				- Failure of temperature regulation centre, causing the temperature to rise.
	- ### Atypical anti-psychotics
	  collapsed:: true
		- Blocks 5HT2 receptor (exceeding affinity for D2 receptor)
		- Rapid dissociation from D2 receptors which allows for lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects
		- **Treat both negative and positive sign of psychosis**
		- **Side effects of atypical anti-psychotics**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Metabolic side effects:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Serotonin regulates caloric intake... blocking of 5HT2 and H1 receptors causes over-eating 
				  collapsed:: true
					- Severe obesity
					- DM
					- Atherosclerosis
			- Extrapyramidal effects
			- Hyperprolactemia effects
			- NMS
			- Sudden death
			- Also binds to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, muscarinic receptors, histaminergic receptors
			  collapsed:: true

			- Despite high cost, the lower risk of extrapyramidal effects still cause them to have a high use rate.
		- **Graded dose reduction is required**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Using typical antipsychotics, causes increase number and sensitivity,
			- Immediate withdrawal can cause super-sensitivity psychosis
	- ### Other uses of anti-psychotics
	  collapsed:: true
		- Also treating mild mood disorder, everyday anxiety, insomnia and mild emotional discomfort
		- Also approved for treating severe depression
		- Use in anxiety disorders?
		  collapsed:: true
			- No effect or inconsistent results, no FDA approval
			- Still prescribed for mild mood disorder
		- Also used for children in foster care
		  collapsed:: true
			- Pharmaceutical company advertise that the children in foster care are more likely to develop psychiatric disorders, their influence greatly increases use of antipsychotics in foster care.
			- **But this is generally not true**. Pyschosis episodes caused by schizophrenia are generally rare in children less than 15. (Psychosis Usually develop in older teens (15yo) and early adulthood.)
			  collapsed:: true
				- So most likely it is the influence of pharmaceutical companies, who would want to increase profit, that lead to this trend of abuse of anti-psychotics in foster care children.
				- This is confirmed by the fact that they generally are given atypical anti-psychotics, which are more expensive, and not approved for use in youth.
			- This is generally unethical, as there are long term effects:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Increased risk of diabetes, and severe obesity.

			- [[Literature Notes]] Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant, embryonal CNS tumour of childhood, that arises by definition from the cerebellum, that results in cerebellar symptoms and hydrocephalus.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Medulloblastoma is a malignant embryonal tumour that occurs in children, exclusively in the vermis of the cerebellum (by definition).
				- **Histopathology of medulloblastoma**
				  collapsed:: true
					- Histological features includes sheets of small, dark, *primitive-appearing* cells.
					- They generally have High H:C ratio, and a hyperchromatic nuclei that accounts for its appearance.
					- A key feature are **Homer Wright Rosettes**
				- **Sequelae of a medulloblastoma**
				  collapsed:: true
					- A medulloblastoma developed on the vermis of the cerebellum (anterior surface) may cause it to protrude onto the ventricular system, resulting in ventricular obstruction, and hydrocephalus.
					- As it directly grows from the cerebellum, cerebellar symptoms are a common clinical feature.

			- [[Literature Notes]] Intracranial schwannomas arise from schwann cells in cranial nerve roots, where the context of the tumour determines the clinical picture.
				- Schwannomas are benign tumour arising from schwann cells at nerve roots, either cranial nerve roots, or peripheral nerve.
				- When intracranial schwannommas are concerned, the context of the tumour determines the clinical manifestation:
				- Acoustic schwannoma develops in CN VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve), is associated with the auditory symptoms, such as **deafness and tinnitus**.
				- Trigeminal schwannoma develops in CN V (trigeminal nerve) is associated with sensory symptoms of the face, and weakness of muscles of mastication.
				- Schwannomas can also cause** brainstem compression**.
