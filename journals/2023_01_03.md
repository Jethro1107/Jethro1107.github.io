	  collapsed:: true
		- The pharynx is a common chamber for the respiratory system and the digestive system
		- {{embed ((63b385b7-e8c1-4a59-8da0-e8de98ee17dd))}}
		- So basically pharynx is separated into the nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx
			- The nasopharynx and oropharynx is separated by the soft palate
		- Pharyngeal constrictor muscles
			- The pharynx is characterised by 3 pharyngeal constrictor muscles that wrap around the pharynx laterally. (superior, middle and inferior). Posteriorly, the 3 muscles attach to the pharyngeal raphe.
			- Superior pharyngeal muscle
				- Anteriorly attaches to the pterygomandibular raphe
			- Middle pharyngeal muscle
				- Anteriorly attaches to the superior surface of the greater horn of the hyoid bone and the associated stylohyoid ligament
			- Inferior pharyngel muscle attaches to the external oblique line of the thyroid cartilage
			- Collective action:
				- They constrict the pharyngeal muscles
			- Innervation:
				- They are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
		- Longitudinal muscles of the pharynx
			- Salpingopharyngeus
				- Originate from the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube
			- Stylopharyngeus
				- Originates from the styloid process
			- Palatopharyngeus
			  id:: 63b38e93-14e5-455c-b4b5-7a3dba664a8d
				- Originates from the superior surface of the palatine aponeurosis
			- Innervation:
				- Except for the stylopharyngeus (which is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve), they are all innervated pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
		- The [[Soft palate]]
			- hangs off the hard palate and separtes the nasopharynx and oropharynx
		- Pharyngeal lymphatics: the tonsilar ring
			- Palatine tonsils - located between the two arches, palatoglossal arch, and the palatopharyngeal arch.
			- Pharyngeal tonsils (Adenoids) - located in pharyngeal recess
			- Lingual tonsils - behind tongue
		- Pharyngeal fascia
			- The pharynx is characterised by a bucopharyngeal fascia and a pharyngobasilar fascia
				- The buccopharyngeal phasia is the external and thinner layer
				- The pharyngobasillar fascia lines the inner surface of oharyngeal muscles.
			- Further surrounded by pretracheal fascia with outer prevertebral part and inner alar part.
			- The bucopharyngeal fascia and the prevertebral fascia enclose the retropharyngeal space.
		- Blood supply
			- Arterial supply by ascending pharyngeal artery
			- Venous drainage by pharyngeal plexus
		- Lymphatics
			- Drains into retropharyngeal ln, into jugulodigastric node (deep cervical node), into IJV

	- Musculoligamentous structure with a cartilaginous framework, short tube for passage of air between pharynx and trachea
		- Unlike other cavities as learnt in the hnns block, which is defined by a bony framework, the larynx is defined by its cartilaginous framework
	- The larynx is made of:
		- Three unpaired cartilages... thyroid, cricoid, and epiglottis
		- Three paired cartilages... arytenoids, corniculates, cuneiforms
		- Various fibroelastic membranes, or ligaments, and intrinsic muscles
	- One can consider the larynx as being suspended from the hyoid muscle by membranes and ligaments: This renders the larynx highly mobile, enabling it to essentially elevate and depressed, opening and closing the laryngeal inlet and the esophagus posteriorly.
	- Cartilage framework
		- Cricoid cartilage
			- The most inferior cartilage of the larynx
			- It is characterised by a broad laminae encircling the posterior end of the larynx, and a much narrower arch, encircling the anterior end of the larynx
			- Posteriorly characterised by two oval depressions separating a middle ridge. The posterior oval depressions are for attachment of cricoaretynoid muscles.
		- Thyroid cartilage
			- The thyroid cartilage is the largest cartilage of the larynx
			- It is characterised by two broad pieces of cartilage, the left and right laminae, which meet at the midline anteriorly to give the laryngeal prominence (adams apple)
			- It is characterised laterally by the external oblique line
			- The posterior margins of the lamina of thyroid cartilage are elongated to form the superior horn and the inferior horn
		- Aretynoids
			- Apex, vocal process, muscular process
			- Apex projects superiorly, and is for articulation with corniculates
			- The voal process projects anteriorly, for the attachment of vocalis and associated vocal ligament, i.e. vocal cords
		- Epiglottis
			- Leaf shaped cartilage
			- Attached to the midline of the thyroid cartilage via the thyro-epilottic ligament
			- Suspended from hyoid bone by hyo-epiglottic ligament
