			- Oral cavity
				- The oral cavity (or mouth) is continuous posteriorly through thepalatoglossal arch with the oropharynx
				- Bony framework:
					- Maxilla, palatine bones, and mandible
					- Hard palate separates nasal cavity from oral cavity
				- Boundaries
					- The oral cavity opens anteriorly to the external environment through the oral fissure, and posteriorly to the oral cavity through the palatoglossal arch
					- It has a roof, which is formed by the hard palate, a floor, and lateral walls
					- Roof:
						- Hard palate, soft palate is technically in the oropharynx
					- Floor:
						- Myohyloid muscles
					- Lateral walls:
						- Made of buccinator muscles, part of the oral group of the oral cavity
						- Its superior attachment: to the maxilla and pterygomaxilary ligament (extending from the maxillary tuberosity to hamulus of the medial pterygoid plate)
						- Its inferior attachment to the external oblique line, up to the first mandibular molar
						- Its posterior attachment to the pterygomandibular raphe (same attachment with the superior pharyngeal constrictor)
				- Division of the oral cavity
					- Oral cavity proper (posterior to teeth) and vestibule (between teeth/gum and cheeks)

	- [[Permanent Notes]] [[The hard palate separates the nasal cavity from the oral cavity, but consists of various foramina that enables passage of neurovasculature between the two cavities]]
		- [[Reference Notes]]
		- [[Literature Notes]] The hard palate is the bony framework that separates the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. But foramina in the hard palate enables the passage of neurovascular structures between the two cavities.
			- The hard palate is formed by the palatine process of the maxilla, horizontal plates of the palatine bone, and a small part of the premaxilla
			- Key features (foramina)
				- Incisive foramen, for passage of nasopalatine nerve to supply part of the hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen
				- Greater palatine foramen
					- Between the maxilla and palatine bone, for passage of greater palatine artery and anterior palatine nerve (greater palatine n.)
				- Lesser palatine foramen
					- Within the palatine bone
					- For middle and posterior palatine nerves (lesser palatine nerve)
			- Arterial supply
				- The hard palate is supplied by the greater palatine artery:
					- A branch of the 3rd part of [[Maxillary artery]] that accompanies the greater palatine nerve down the greater palatine canal, and emerges from greater palatine foramen, passing around the palate, and via incisive foramen passes into the nasal cavity
			- Innervation
				- The greater palatine nerve a branch from the pterygopalatine foramen supplies hard palate up to the incisive foramen
				- Nasopalatine n, passes along the nasal roof, descends along nasal septum through the incisive foramen to supply hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen

- [[Relevant Notes]] [[Soft palate]]
	- [[Permanent Notes]] [[The soft palate is an aponeurosis acted on by 5 muscles, and can separate the nasopharynx from the oropharynx]]
		- [[Reference Notes]]
		- [[Literature Notes]]
			- An apopneurosis of the tensor veli palatini that is acted upon by 5 pairs of muscles
			- Tensor veli palatini
			  collapsed:: true
			  id:: 63b385a4-ea79-4057-a2ea-d9ade67b7c0e
				- Tensor veli palatini originates from scaphoid process of the sphenoid bone and the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube
				- Descend along the lateral side of the medial pterygoid plate, which hooks around the pterygoid hamulus and expands into a flat tendon, the palatine aponeurosis
				- Actions
				  collapsed:: true
					- Tenses up the palatine aponeurosis so that other muscles can act on it.
					- Also regulates opening of the auditory tube
				- Innervation:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Mandibular nerve, via nerve to medial pterygoid
			- Levator veli palatini
			  collapsed:: true
			  id:: 63b385a4-63b1-49da-9f55-b314338ffcd4
				- Originates from quadrate area on petrous part of temporal bone, from medial part of cartilaginous part of auditory tube
				- Forms a round belly that runs forward medially, downwars, and inserts on the upper surface of the palatine aponeurosis
				- Action:
					- Elevates the levator veli palatini
					- Closing off the nasopharynx from oropharynx
				- Innervation:
					- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
			- Palatopharyngeus
			  collapsed:: true
				- The palatopharyngeus originates from 2 heads:
					- The horizontal plate of the palatine bone and the superior surface of the back of the palatine aponeurosis
					- It descends posterolaterally to give rise to the palatopharyngeal arch
				- It inserts at the posterir border of the tyroid cartilage and cornua of hyoid bone,
				- Actions:
					- It elevates larynx and pharynx
					- Depresses soft palate
				- Innervation:
					- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
			- Palatoglossus
			  collapsed:: true
				- The palatoglossus originates from the inferior surface of the palatine aponeurosis
				- It descends anterolaterally to constitute the palatoglossal arch and insert at the lateral side of the tongue
				- Actions:
					- It is sphincteric at oropharyngeal isthmus
					- It raises the tongue
				- Innervation:
					- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
			- Muscular uvulae
			  collapsed:: true
				- The muscular uvulae originates from the posterior nasal spine and the superior surface of the palatine process
				- The muscular uvulae inserts at the mucous membrane of the soft palate.
				- Action:
					- It shapes the uvula and draws the uvula to the ipsilateral side
				- Innervation:
					- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)

- [[Tongue]]
	- The tongue is a bulk of muscle with mucous and serous glands, covered by mucosa, that is present in both the oral cavity and the oropharynx.
	- Anterior 2/3 of the tongue is present in the oral cavity, and posterior 1/3 of the tongue is present in the oropharynx.
	- The anterior and posterior part is also divided by sulcus terminalis... This defines the inferior boundaries of the oropharyngeal isthmus
	- ### Papillae
		- The superior surface of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue is lined by hundreds of papillae
		- 3 types of papillae
			- Filiform - small cone shaped papillae that gives fur rough texture/ friction to tongue, but bears no taste buds
			- Fungiform - Appears as red dots (mushroom shaped), bears taste buds
			- Foliate - Posterolateral border of the tongue, bears serous glands and the taste buds
		- The valiate papillae lies anterior to the sulcus terminalis
			- V shaped, 8-12 in number
			- consists of taste buds
	- ### Inferior surface of the tongue
		- Characterised by a median mucosal fold, the frenulum, that extends from the floor of the oral cavity to the inferior surface of the tongue
		- Lateral to each, is the lingual vein, which is bordered laterally by the fimbriated fold
	- ### Muscles of the tongue
		- Divided into intrinsic muscles and extrinsic muscles
		- Intrinsic muscles of the tongue
			- Originate and insert within the tongue, responsible for determining the shape of the tongue
			- Divided into the superior longitudinal fibres, inferior longitudinal fibres, transverse fibres and vertical fibres
		- Extrinsic tongue muscles
			- Genioglossus
				- Originate from the mandible
			- Hyoglossus
				- Originate from the hyoid bone, latereral to the genioglossus
			- Styloglossus
				- Originate from the styloid process
			- Palatoglossus
				- Originate from the soft palate
