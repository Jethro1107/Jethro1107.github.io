			- [[Literature Notes]] Intracranial tumours, defined as tumours found intracranially, are more likely to be metastatic, rather than a primary intracranial tumour.
				- Intracranial tumours, by definition are neoplasms found intracranially.
				- They are first classified into primary or metastatic intracranial tumours.
					- Most are metastatic, as the the brain receives 25% of cardiac output.

			- [[Literature Notes]] Primary intracranial tumours can be classified into two major groups, those arising from neuroectodermal cells, and those arising from other structures in the cranial cavity.
				- Primary intracranial tumours are basically classified into two major groups:
					- Neuroectodernal tumours
					- Arising from other structures within the cranial cavity
				- Neuroectodermal tumours include:
					- Those arising from glial cells: Gliomas
					- Those arising from neurons and primitive cells: Neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma
				- Other structures within the cranial cavity:
					- Meningioma, Schwannoma (PNS), vascular tumours

			- [[Literature Notes]] Astrocytoma, a common form of glioma originates from astrocytes. Their grading, is a reflection of histological features, which also correlates to its gross pathology, which often informs prognosis.
				- **Astrocytoma**, the most common form of **glioma**, arising from the astrocytes of the central nervous system.
				- In general, they are *classified by the type of astrocytes they originate from*:
					- Fibrillary
					- Pilocytic
				- Gross pathology:
					- Grade 1 astrocytoma are well **circumscribed**, but this kind only arises in children as a circumscribed pilocytic astrocytoma.
					- Grade 2 and 3 astrocytomas are **diffuse**, with infilatration beyond grossly evident margins.
					- **Cystic** degeneration of astrocytomas are often common.
				- Based on histological features, astrocytomas are *stratified into 4 grades with increasingly grim prognosis*:
					- Grade 1 tumours are generally well circumscribed pilocytic astrocytoma, a rather common childhood CNS tumour.
					- Grade 2 tumours are characterised with nuclear pleomorphism.
					- Grade 3 tumours are characterised with mitosis.
					- Grade 4 tumours are characterised with necrosis, as they generally outgrow their vascular supply. There is also vascular endothelial hyperplasia, as a result of marked ischemia that prompts secretion of VEGF for angiogenesis.

			- [[Literature Notes]]
				- Glioblastoma multiformes, a term that should no longer exist, develops from a pre-existing astrocytoma by progressive malignant transformation.
				- It is a grade 4 astrocytoma, with histological manifestations such as:
					- Necrosis and haemorrhage
					- Endothelial proliferation (often forming tufts of vessels called glomerular bodies)
					- Pseudo-palisades
				- Its mode of metastasis, local invasion by infiltrative growth, often results in spread into the ventricular system and subarachnoid space.

			- [[Literature Notes]]  Oligodendroglioma, a form of glioma arising from oligodendrocytes are a less aggressive form of glioma with characteristic histological features.
				- Oligodendrocytes are the lesser common form of gliomas.
				- They are generally well-circumscribed, with little necrosis.
				- Usually found in cerebral hemispheres, particularly in the frontal lobe and the temporal lobe.
				- Classical histology is a box-shaped cell, with clear cytoplasmic halo.

			- [[Literature Notes]] While pathophysiology tells us an intracranial tumour can caused raised intracranial pressure and a sequelae of herniation, it is the context of the tumour, particularly its rate of growth and location that informs the clinical picture.
				- In general, intracranial tumours can cause raised intracranial pressure, which triggers the sequelae of herniation.
				- But the clinical picture, largely depends on the nature of growth, and its location.
				- At the "correct" location, compressing on the "right" structure, even low-grade or even benign tumours can result cause severe neurological defects, and could even be fatal.
