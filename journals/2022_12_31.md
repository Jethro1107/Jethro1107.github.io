		- So... [[Muscles of facial expression]]... they are for facial expression, what are their key features
			- They are essentially small, thin muscle bundles located within the subcutaneous fascia (very difficult to fully isolate during dissection, but I have actually successfuly isolated the platysma)
			- With origins from either bone or fascia, and insertion onto the skin. Hence, they move the skin, and are responsible for facial expression.
			- They are not covered by the investing (deep fascia), that is with the exception of the Buccinator
			- They all develop from the second pharyngeal arch and are all innervated by the facial nerve
		- Functions:
			- Sphincters and dilators of facial orifices
			- Protection (for the eyes)
			- Support for food ingestion and closing mouth for swallowing
			- Involved in sound production
			- For facial expression, developed secondarily, but almost the most important feature
		- Muscle of the scalp
			- Occipitalis and frontalis gives [[Occipitofrontalis]]
				- The occipitalis consists of an frontalis, and occipitalis connected by an epicranial aponeurosis
				- Movements:
					- Raise the eyebrows, wrinkles the forehead
			- Anterior auricular
			- Superior auricular
			- Posterior auricular
		- [[Orbital group of muscles of facial expression]]
			- Sphincter of the eye: Orbicularis oculi
				- Consists of 3 parts:
					- Orbital parts - broad circle enclosing the orbital oriface, responsible for closing eyelid forcefully
					- Palpebral part - corresponds to the eyelids, responsible for closing eyelid gently
					- Lacrimal part - deep, medially, connects the bone deep to lacrimal sac to the lacrimal apparatus within the orbit.
			- Corrugator supercilii
				- Lies deep to the eyebrrows and the orbicularis oculi
				- Originate from medial end of the supracilliary arch, and inserts laterally to the skin of the eyebrows
				- Movement:
					- Draws eyebrows together when frowning
			- Depressor supercilli
		- [[Nasal group of muscles of facial expression]]
			- Procerus
			- Nasalis
			- Depressor septi nasi
		- [[Oral group of muscles of facial expression]]
			- Orbicularis oris
				- Sphincter of the mouth
				- Complex system of muscle fibres encircling the lips
				- Movement
					- Narrows mouth and closes the lips, pursing the lips
			- Muscles of the upper lips
				- Levator labii superioris
				- Levator anguli  oris
				- Zygomaticus major and minor
			- Muscles of the lower lips
				- Depressor anguli oris
					- Depressor anguli oris originates laterally from the inferior end of the body of the mandible, and inserts superiorly to the corner of the lips
					- It depresses the corner of the lips
				- Depressor labii  inferioris
					- Depressor labii inferioris originates deep to the depressor anguli oris medially, and inserts to the lower lips
				- Mentalis
					- Deepest muscles of the lower lips
						- Originates medially at the level of the incisors, ascends and inserts at the skin of the chin
			- Risorius
				-
			- Buccinator
			  id:: 63bd7dad-de64-42f4-97b5-4d7d1ec14b1c
				- Lies deep to many muscles, between the mandible and the maxilla
				- It originates from the pterygomandibular raphe, and the posterior part of the maxilla, and inserts onto the to the corner of the mouth, blending with the orbicularis oris in a unique fashion
			- Platysma
	- Innervation of head and scalp
	  collapsed:: true
		- Sensory innervation
			- The face and anterior scalp is supplied by the trigeminal nerve, while the posterior scalp is supplied by C2
			- [[Branches of the trigeminal nerve provide sensory innervation to the face]]
				- The opthalmic division enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure
					- It gives the Supraorbital n. and supratrochlear n that pass superiorly
					- Infratrochlear n. which leave through the medial angle of the
					- Lacrimal n. which leaves via the lateral side
					- External nasal n. which supplies anterior nasal part of the nose.
				- Maxillary part drop through the foramen rotundum
					- Inferior orbital n. leaves through the infraorbital foramen on maxilla
					- Zygomaticotemporal -
					- Zygomaticofacial
				- Mandibular division drops through foramen ovale
					- Auricotemporal n.
					- Buccal n.
					- Mental n.
			- [[Branches of facial nerve innervate the muscles of facial expression]]
				- As the facial nerve drops through the stylomastoid foramen of the temporal bone, and courses into the parotid gland, it divides into major branches.
				- From superior to inferior:
					- Temporal zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular cervical
					- And posteriorly the posterior auricular
	- Vascular supply of the face
		- Arterial supply
			- Provided by the facial artery
				- As it emerges from the mandible anterior to the masseter, in enters and supplies the face
				- 3 branches
					- Inferior labial artery - supplies lower lip
					- Superior labial artery - supplies upper lip
				- Terminates as angular artery on the medial aspect of the eye
			- Provided by the transverse facial artery, a branch of the superficial temporal artery
- [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]]
  collapsed:: true
	- Course of the trigeminal nerve
		- The trigeminal nerve emerges on the anterior surface of the pons s a large sensory root and a small motor root., passes forward out of the posterior cranial fossa, into the middle cranial fossa, and rests on the upper apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone.
		- The sensory root expand to form a crescent shape trigeminal ganglion (enclosed with a fold of dura mater called trigeminal cave), which divides into the 3 divisions.
		- The opthalmic division (v1) leaves the cranial cavity into the orbit via the superior orbital fissure (between the lesser and greater wing of the ethmoid bone), the maxillary division leaves through the foramen rotundum, the mandibular division (v3) which is the only division carrying both sensory and motor fibres, leaves through the foramen ovale

		- Spinal trigeminal nucleus (sensory)
			- Is extends inferiorly through the length of the medulla and to the spinal cord, as afar as the second cervical segment
		- Potine trigeminal nucleus/main sensory nucleus (sensory)
			- Found dorsally in the caudal pons, continuous inferiorly with the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and superiorly with the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus

	- Sensory component of the trigeminal nerve
	  id:: 63b385a4-72ae-466e-bf59-be67c8d25e9d
		- Somatosensation from the skin and mucous membranes of the face travel via the axons to the trigeminal ganglion, where the central axon pass through the large sensory root of the trigeminal nerve.
		- Those responsible for discriminatory touch, pressure and vibrations are projected to the pontine trigeminal nucleus
		- Those fibres detecting for pain and temperature pass to the spinal trigeminal nucleus.
		- The fibres divide into ascending branches that terminate at the main sensory nucleus, and descending branches that terminate at the spinal sensory nucleus
		- Proprioceptive impulses from muscles of mastication, peridontal membrane, temporomandibular joint and external ocular muscles are bypass the trigeminal ganglion. These are fibres originating from the unipolar cells of the mesencephalic nucleus.
		- The fibres from the pontine trigeminal nucleus, spinal sensory nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus project via the trigeminal lamniscus to the VPM nucleus of the thalamus, that project to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebral cortex. (the so called [[Trigeminothalamic tract]])
	- Motor components of the trigeminal nerve
		- The motor nucleus receives cortical command through the pyramidal tract Sends axons of via the motor root, via the mandibular division to supply muscles of mastication: Tensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, anterior belly od digastric, myohyoid, temporalis and masseter muscle
