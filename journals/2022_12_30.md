- Vascular supply of the head and neck
	- ### Arterial supply of the head and neck
		- Arterial supply of the head and neck is provided by the common carotid arteries, and branches of the subclavian arteries, that is the vertebral artery, thyrocervical trunk and costocervical trunk
		- [[Common carotid artery]] (initially enclosed in the carotid sheath) bifurcates into the internal carotid artery and external carotid artery at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. The bifurcation is marked by two specialised organs that perform homeostatic functions:
			- Carotid body - At the bifurcation, deep in the adventitia, consists of chemoreceptors for the chemoreceptor reflex
			- Carotid sinus - A dilitation of the internal carotid artery just above the bifurcation. Houses baroreceptors for the baroreceptor reflex.
		- [[Internal carotid artery]]
			- Cervical part - extends from bifurcation to temporal bone
			- Petrous part (found in the carotid canal within the petrous part of the temporal bone)
			- Cavernous part - S shaped within the carvernous sinus
			- Cerebral part - gives its branches
				- Contributes to opthalmic artery
				- Terminal branches MCA and ACA contributes to anterior circulation of the brain
			- Supply
				- Does not contribute to blood supply of the face and scalp, neck region, only to the brain and contents of the orbit
		- [[External carotid artery]]
			- 8 branches
				- Anterior group: Superior thyroid artery, lingual artery, fascial artery
					- Superior thyroid artery - An initial branch from the ECA, passes anteriorly and inferiorly to supply the superior pole of the thyroid gland
					- Lingual artery - 2nd anterior branch from the ECA, passes anteriorly,deep to the hypoglossal nerve, and between the middle pharyngeal constrictor and hypoglossus muscle to supply the tongue
					- Fascial artery - 3rd and final anterior branch of the ECA, passes deep to the stylohyoid muscle and posterior belly of digastric muscle, continues between the submandibular gland and the mandible, and emerges over the mandible anterior to the masseter muscle to enter and supply the face.
				- Posterior group: Ascending pharyngeal artery, occipital artery, posterior auricular artery
					- Ascending pharyngeal artery - Small branch ascending between the ICA and Pharynx
					- Occipital artery - Passes deep to posterior belly of digastric muscle, and curls deep to the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and emerges on the posterior aspect of the scalp
					- Posterior auricular artery - passes upward and posteriorly, behind the external auditory meatus opening of the temporal bone
				- Terminal branches: maxillary artery, superficial temporal artery
					- Maxillary artery - The larger terminal branch that passes through the neck of the mandible (between the sphenomandibular ligament and neck of mandible), through the parotid gland and enters the infratemporal fossa, then passes into the pterygomaxillary fissure and into the pterygopalatine fossa
					- Superficial temporal artery - The smaller terminal branch that ascends across
		- [[Thyrocervical trunk]]
			- A branch of the subclavian artery
			- Gives off 3 branches:
				- Inferior thyroid artery as the continuation of the thyrocervical trunk, passes posterior to the carotid sheath, and anterior to the vertebral arteries, to supply the inferior pole of the thyroid gland
				- Transverse cervical artery and suprascapular artery
		- Arterial anastamosis in the head and neck
			- Provide collateral blood supply when internal carotid artery is blocked (theoretically). But this is only true in gradual stenosis of ICA, which allows time for other vessels to compensate.
			- Opthalmic artery-Fascial artery anastamosis
			- Opthalmic artery-Superior temporal artery anastamosis
			- Occipital artery-meningeal artery anastamosis
	- ### Venous drainge of head and neck
		- Drained by superficial veins, such as **anterior jugular veins and external jugular veins**, and deep veins, such as internal jugular veins
		- [[Superficial veins of the neck]]
			- Originates from the submental triangle
			- Tributaries
			- Drainage
				- Drains into external jugular vein or directly into subclavian vein
				- The left and righ anterior jugular vein may communicate via an anterior jugular arch
		- External jugular vein
			- Drains superficial structures of the head and neck
			- Formed by the union of the posterior auricular vein and posterior branch of retromandibular vein
			- Tributaries
				- Posterior external jugular vein
				- Anterior jugular vein
				- Suprascapular vein
				- Transverse cervical vein
			- Drainage
				- Drains into subclavian vein
		- [[Internal jugular vein]]
			- Drains the brain and deep structures of the head
			- Course
				- A continuation of sigmoid sinus, Begins at the hugular foramen after receiving blood from the dural venous sinus. Descends throough carotid sheath from posterior cranial fossa.
			- Major extracranial tributaries (similar to branches ot external carotid artery)
				- Superior thyroid vein
				- Lingual vein
				- Common facial vein
				- Middle thyroid vein
				- Pharyngeal vein
				- Occipital vein
			- Drainage
				- Joins subclavian vein to form brachiochephalic vein
		- [[Retromandibular vein]]
			- The retromandibular vein is formed by the union of the superior temporal vein and the maxillary vein, in the substance of the parotid glands, and descends along the ramus of the mandible to its angle.
			- It then divides into the anterior division and posterior division.
			- The anterior division joins the facial vein to form the common facial vein, which is one of the tributaries of the internal jugular vein
			- The posterior division joins the posterior auricular vein to form the external jugular veins.
- ## Cerebral arterial circle (Grays anatomy) [[Circle of Willis]]
	- The cerebral arterial circle (of Willis) is formed at the base of the brain by the interconnecting vertebrobasilar and internal carotid systems of vessels ( [Fig. 8.38](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0195) ). This anastomotic interconnection is accomplished by:
		- an anterior communicating artery connecting the left and right anterior cerebral arteries to each other, and
		- two posterior communicating arteries, one on each side, connecting the internal carotid artery with the posterior cerebral artery ( [Figs. 8.38](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0195) and [8.39](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0200) ).
- Fascia of the neck
	- Superficial fascia
		- Consists of subcutaneous tissue and VAN, and platysma (muscle of fascial expression)
	- Deep fascia
		- Prevertebral fascia - surround vertebral musculature and vertebral contents
		- Pretracheal fascia - surrounds viscera such as pharynx and esophagus
		- Investing fascia - surrounds all structures of the neck
		- Carotid sheath
			- Surrounds the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein and vagus nerve
			- Receives contributions to all 3 fascia of the neck.
