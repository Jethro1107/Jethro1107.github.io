			- [[Literature Notes]] The ear is a 3 part tube that conducts vibrations laterally to medially.
				- The ear consists of 3 parts:
					- The external ear, which consists of the auricle, the part that is attached to the lateral aspects of the head, and the external acoustic meatus.
					- The middle ear, which is a cavity that lies within the petrous part of the temporal bone.
					- The inner ear, a series of cavities within the petrous part of the temporal bone that is bordered laterally by the middle ear, and medially by the internal acoustic meatus.

			- [[Literature Notes]] The auricle is the visible part of the ear that laterally attaches to the face, with a cartilagenous framework that gives its distinctive structure for capturing sound.
				- The external ear consists of the auricle, and the external acoustic meatus.
					- The auricle is attached to the lateral aspect of the head, for the collection of sounds.
					- It is formed by a cartilagenous framework that forms several elevations and grooves.
					- The large semicircular outer ring is called the helix, which ends inferiorly as a lobe of fatty tissue called the lobule.
						- The lobule is the only part that that does not consist of cartilage.
					- Within the helix, is another semicircular elevation called the antihelix.
					- Anteriorly, there is an elevation called the tragus, and opposite to it, at the level of the lobule, is another elevation called the antitragus.
					- The central hollow area is the concha of the auricle, which is continuous with the external acoustic meatus.

				- The external acoustic meatus is the part of the external ear that extends from the deep ends of the choncha of the auricle to the tympanic membrane.
				- It passes, not straight laterally to medially, but passes slightly anterosuperiorly, then somewhat posteriorly.
					- This is clinically significant: To clearly visualise the external acoustic meatus to the tympanic membrane, it is best to visualise the auricle superiorly, posteriorly and laterally.
				- The lateral third is surrounded by cartilage, while the medial two thirds is surrounded by bone, particularly entering the opening for the external acoustic meatus in the temporal bone.

				- The tympanic membrane is roughly a membrane that separates the external acoustic meatus and the middle ear.
				- It is slanted medially, from the top to bottom.
				- Key features are identified of the tympanic membrane
					- The malleus attaches to the internal surface of tympanic membrane, forming the umbo of the tympanic membrane.
					- Passing superiorly, is the attachment of the malleus. Where at its most superior end, the lateral process of the malleus protrudes onto the tympanic membrane.
					- Anteroinferiorly to the umbo of the tympanic membrane, is the cone of light, which is visible when shining a light onto the tympanic membrane with an otoscope.
					- Superior to the lateral process of malleus, the tympanic membrane laxed (pars flaccida)
					- The rest of the tympanic membrane is thick and taut (pars tensa).

			- [[Literature Notes]] Because stroke is associated with pathologies of cardiac origins, and may also cause cardiac pathologies, it is generally wise to concurrently monitor cardiac functions in a patient presenting with stroke with simple ECG.
				- Stroke and cardiac diseases are closely related, in a sense that stroke can cause, or be caused by cardiac diseases.
					- Patients presenting with stroke may **concurrently develop myocardial ischaemia**.
						- This is because ischaemic stroke and and MI are caused by the same pathological process, they generally are associated with **overlapping risk factors**... Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia etc.
							- Hence, **patients presenting with stroke often has harbouring myocardial ischaemia** due to aetherosclerotic plaques.
							- With the a **sympathetic response to stroke**, it may result in demand-induced myocardial ischaemia impending on myocardial infarction.
						- The situation worsens, as if it presents as PICA syndrome, due to the contralateral pain and temperature sensation loss due to the loss of lateral spinothalamic function pathways, they are **unable to report chest pain**.
					- Other than MI, stroke is associated with diseases causing **cardiac mural thrombus**. More commonly atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease.
				- Assessment of cardiac functions thus makes sense, as to **identify risk factors**, or **prevent clinical manifestations of ischaemic heart disease**.
					- **ECG** should be performed.
					- If there is clinical suspicion for endocarditis, or any other forms of emboli of cardiac origins, echocardiogram is indicated, but can be delayed to when the patient is in stable condition.
			- [[Fleeting Notes]]
				- I remember from CPRS PBL, the case on atrial fibrillation, when I discovered that stroke and cardiac pathologies are bidirectionally related... I really should pull up the google docs of the case.

					- I remember this clinical key paper helped me do my learning objective.
					- Atrial fibrillation results in a high systemic embolisation risk, and can result in ischaemic stroke.
				- Someone alway showed this score: **CHA2DS2-VASc score (threshold for starting anticoagulants)** and the **HAS-BLED Score**
					- **balance benefits and risks with respect to reduction in risk of stroke and increment in risk of bleeding**

					- In eligible patients, repurfusion therapy by intravenous thrombolysis with ateplase is best.
						- It induces fibrinolysis to dissolve the clot.
						- Patients are only eligible if given within 4.5 hours of last known time well, and are not indicated to have an intracranial haemorrhage.
					- If large vessel occlusion, it may be treated with mechanical thrombectomy.

				- In HNNS PBL case 1 tutorial 1, the patient's husband requested a drug to resolve the clot (even there is no clot to resolve). IVT with ateplase is most likely the drug he is referring to.
					- But this begs the question, since the patient most likely didn't meet eligible criteria (I have to read up more on the criteria), repurfusion therapy is not indicated and initiated.
						- But what if we did?
							- Is it associated with increase risk of intracranial haemorrhage, causing a stroke of opposite nature (ischaemic to haemorrhagic)?
