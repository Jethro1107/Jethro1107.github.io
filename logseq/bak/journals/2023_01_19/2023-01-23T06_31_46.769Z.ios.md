				- The lacrimal apparatus is a system of structures that are involved in the production, movement, and drainage of tears.
				- The **lacrimal gland** lies superolaterally within the orbit, separated by the tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris.
					- It produces tears.
				- The tears generally flow laterally to medially when we blink.
				- It subsequently drains into the **lacrimal puncta**, which drains into the lacrimal cannaliculus, which drains into the **lacrimal sac**.
				- The **Lacrimal sac** drains into nasal cavity, anteriorly, in the inferior meatus. This is via the **nasolacrimal duct**.
