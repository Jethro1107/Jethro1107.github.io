	- Bony framework:
		- Maxilla, palatine bones, and mandible

		- It has a roof, which is formed by the hard palate, a floor, and lateral walls
		- Roof:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Hard palate, soft palate is technically in the oropharynx
		- Floor:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Myohyloid muscles
		- Lateral walls:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Made of buccinator muscles, part of the oral group of the oral cavity
			- Its superior attachment: to the maxilla and pterygomaxilary ligament (extending from the maxillary tuberosity to hamulus of the medial pterygoid plate)
			- Its inferior attachment to the external oblique line, up to the first mandibular molar
			- Its posterior attachment to the pterygomandibular raphe (same attachment with the superior pharyngeal constrictor)
	- Division of the oral cavity
	  collapsed:: true
		- Oral cavity proper (posterior to teeth) and vestibule (between teeth/gum and cheeks)
- # [[Hard palate]]
  collapsed:: true
	- The hard palate is formed by the palatine process of the maxilla, horizontal plates of the palatine bone, and a small part of the premaxilla
	- Key features (foramina)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Incisive foramen, for passage of nasopalatine nerve to supply part of the hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen
		- Greater palatine foramen
		  collapsed:: true
			- Between the maxilla and palatine bone, for passage of greater palatine artery and anterior palatine nerve (greater palatine n.)
		- Lesser palatine foramen
		  collapsed:: true
			- Within the palatine bone
			- For middle and posterior palatine nerves (lesser palatine nerve)
	- Arterial supply
	  collapsed:: true
		- The hard palate is supplied by the greater palatine artery:
		  collapsed:: true
			- A branch of the 3rd part of [[Maxillary artery]] that accompanies the greater palatine nerve down the greater palatine canal, and emerges from greater palatine foramen, passing around the palate, and via incisive foramen passes into the nasal cavity
	- Innervation
	  collapsed:: true
		- The greater palatine nerve a branch from the pterygopalatine foramen supplies hard palate up to the incisive foramen
		- Nasopalatine n, passes along the nasal roof, descends along nasal septum through the incisive foramen to supply hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen
- # [[Soft palate]]
  collapsed:: true
	- An apopneurosis of the tensor veli palatini that is acted upon by 5 pairs of muscles
	- Tensor veli palatini
	  collapsed:: true
		- Tensor veli palatini originates from scaphoid process of the sphenoid bone and the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube
		- Descend along the lateral side of the medial pterygoid plate, which hooks around the pterygoid hamulus and expands into a flat tendon, the palatine aponeurosis
		- Actions
		  collapsed:: true
			- Tenses up the palatine aponeurosis so that other muscles can act on it.
			- Also regulates opening of the auditory tube
		- Innervation:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Mandibular nerve, via nerve to medial pterygoid
	- Levator veli palatini
	  collapsed:: true
		- Originates from quadrate area on petrous part of temporal bone, from medial part of cartilaginous part of auditory tube
		- Forms a round belly that runs forward medially, downwars, and inserts on the upper surface of the palatine aponeurosis
		- Action:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Elevates the levator veli palatini
			- Closing off the nasopharynx from oropharynx
		- Innervation:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
	- Palatopharyngeus
	  collapsed:: true
		- The palatopharyngeus originates from 2 heads:
		  collapsed:: true
			- The horizontal plate of the palatine bone and the superior surface of the back of the palatine aponeurosis
			- It descends posterolaterally to give rise to the palatopharyngeal arch
		- It inserts at the posterir border of the tyroid cartilage and cornua of hyoid bone,
		- Actions:
		  collapsed:: true
			- It elevates larynx and pharynx
			- Depresses soft palate
		- Innervation:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
	- Palatoglossus
	  collapsed:: true
		- The palatoglossus originates from the inferior surface of the palatine aponeurosis
		- It descends anterolaterally to constitute the palatoglossal arch and insert at the lateral side of the tongue
		- Actions:
		  collapsed:: true
			- It is sphincteric at oropharyngeal isthmus
			- It raises the tongue
		- Innervation:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
	- Muscular uvulae
	  collapsed:: true
		- The muscular uvulae originates from the posterior nasal spine and the superior surface of the palatine process
		- The muscular uvulae inserts at the mucous membrane of the soft palate.
		- Action:
		  collapsed:: true
			- It shapes the uvula and draws the uvula to the ipsilateral side
		- Innervation:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Pharyngeal plexus (CN X)
- # [[Tongue]]
  collapsed:: true
	- The tongue is a bulk of muscle with mucous and serous glands, covered by mucosa, that is present in both the oral cavity and the oropharynx.
	- Anterior 2/3 of the tongue is present in the oral cavity, and posterior 1/3 of the tongue is present in the oropharynx.
	- The anterior and posterior part is also divided by sulcus terminalis... This defines the inferior boundaries of the oropharyngeal isthmus
	- ### Papillae
	  collapsed:: true
		- The superior surface of the anterior 2/3 of the tongue is lined by hundreds of papillae
		- 3 types of papillae
		  collapsed:: true
			- Filiform - small cone shaped papillae that gives fur rough texture/ friction to tongue, but bears no taste buds
			- Fungiform - Appears as red dots (mushroom shaped), bears taste buds
			- Foliate - Posterolateral border of the tongue, bears serous glands and the taste buds
		- The valiate papillae lies anterior to the sulcus terminalis
		  collapsed:: true
			- V shaped, 8-12 in number
			- consists of taste buds
	- ### Inferior surface of the tongue
	  collapsed:: true
		- Characterised by a median mucosal fold, the frenulum, that extends from the floor of the oral cavity to the inferior surface of the tongue
		- Lateral to each, is the lingual vein, which is bordered laterally by the fimbriated fold
	- ### Muscles of the tongue
	  collapsed:: true
		- Divided into intrinsic muscles and extrinsic muscles
		- Intrinsic muscles of the tongue
		  collapsed:: true
			- Originate and insert within the tongue, responsible for determining the shape of the tongue
			- Divided into the superior longitudinal fibres, inferior longitudinal fibres, transverse fibres and vertical fibres
		- Extrinsic tongue muscles
		  collapsed:: true
			- Genioglossus
			  collapsed:: true
				- Originate from the mandible
			- Hyoglossus
			  collapsed:: true
				- Originate from the hyoid bone, latereral to the genioglossus
			- Styloglossus
			  collapsed:: true
				- Originate from the styloid process
			- Palatoglossus
			  collapsed:: true
