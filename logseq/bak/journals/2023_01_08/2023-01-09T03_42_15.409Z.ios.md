			- [[Literature Notes]] The 3 regions of the nasal cavity is lined with its own epithelium.
				- The nasal cavity is separated into 3 regions, each lined with its own type of epithelium.
					- The vestibule, which is lies anteriorly, and serves as the continuation of the skin into the nares
					- The respiratory region, occupying much of the nasal cavity is lined with the characteristic respiratory epithelium.
					- The olfactory region, occupying the roof and the superior conchae, is lined with olfactory epithelium
