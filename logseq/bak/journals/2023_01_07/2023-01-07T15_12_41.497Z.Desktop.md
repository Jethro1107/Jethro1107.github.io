			- [[Literature Notes]] Within the infratemporal fossa, the branches of the 1st and 2nd part of the middle meningeal artery supply the cranial meninges, and contents within the infratemmporal fossa.
				- The maxillary artery is the largest branch of the external carotid artery, and provides a bulk of the blood supply to the nasal cavity, lateral walls and roof of the oral cavity, all teeth, the dura mater (especially that in the middle cranial fossa), and the contents within the infratemporal fossa.
				- Course
					- It originates within the substance of the parotid gland, as a terminal branch of the external carotid artery, passes through the infratemporal fossa, and through the pterygopalatine fossa where it gives terminal branches.
				- 3 parts of the maxillary artery
					- The 1st part of the maxillary artery is located between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of the mandible.
					- The 2nd part of the maxillary artery is located within the infratemporal fossa, and ascends obliquely towards the pterygomaxillary fissure.
					- The 3rd part of the maxillary artery is located within the pterygomaxillary fissure and passes into the pterygopalatine fossa.
				- Key branches of the maxillary artery
					- 1st part gives two key branches: the middle meningeal artery and the inferior alveolar artery.
						- Middle meningeal artery
							- It ascends up and accompanies the meningeal nerve to pass through the foramen spinosum into the middle cranial fossa.
						- Inferior alveolar artery
							- It descends between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of the mandible, accompanying the inferior alveolar nerve through the mandibular foramen into the mandibular canal.
					- 2nd part gives rise to: deep temporal artery, the pterygoid artery, masseteric artery, and buccal artery
						- They all accompany their corresponding nerves

			  collapsed:: true
				- The pterygoid plexus is a network of veins that span between different layers within the infratemporal fossa, namely between the medial and lateral pyterygoid, and between the lateral pterygoid and the temporalis muscle.
				- Drainage
				  collapsed:: true
					- It drains anteriorly into the facial vein (via the inferior opthalmic vein and deep facial vein), and posteriorly, via a short maxillary vein that joins the retromandibular vein.
				- Tributaries
				  collapsed:: true
					- Its tributaries, provide venous drainage from nasal cavity, oral cavity, teeth, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, contents in infratemporal fossa.
				- It has emissary veins that pass through the roof of infratemporal fossa, communicating with the carvenous sinus.
				  collapsed:: true
					- This enables infections of the nasal cavity, oral cavity etc to spread via the pterygoid plexus and enter intracranially, resulting in a life-threatening condition called carvenous thrombosis.

			- [[Literature Notes]] CNS infections are broadly classified into 4 types
				- Classification of CNS infection
					- CNS infection is classified into 4 types:
						- Meningitis - Infection of the meninges, mainly involving the subarachnoid space and its two coverings, the overlying arachnoid mater and the pia mater underneath
						- Encephalitis - Infection of the brain (and spinal cord) parenchyma
						- Intracranial abscess - Collection of pus, which can be intracerebral or intraspinal, epidural or subdural
						- Suppurative intracranial thrombophlebitis - Occurs in major venous sinuses
			- [[Fleeting Notes]]
				- Essentially, a central nervous system infection can affected the brain parenchyma (encephalitis), the covering of the brain (meningitis), result in an abscess, or affect its vasculature.

			- [[Literature Notes]] Acute bacterial meningitis can almost always be identified by its classical clinical presentation, but is usually diagnosed with lumbar puncture.
				- Acute bacterial is the infection of the meninges.
				- It is results in inflamed meninges
				- Clinical features
					- In acute bacterial meningitis, patients are quite ill, with systemic symptoms such as high fever, severe and generalised headache and lethargy.
					- The clinical picture is dominated by the effects of meningeal irritation, resulting in headaches, neck stiffness. They often have positive Kernig sign and brudzinski sign.
					- The underlying brain parenchyma is often spared, until late stages. Hence, there is normal conscious state, and minimal neurological signs.

				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1673084052117_0.png)
			- [[Literature Notes]] Various virulence factors of nasopharyngeal microbes underlie the pathogenesis of acute bacterial meningitis
				- Often during the winter, our nasopharyngeal mucosa is asymptomatically colonised by various nasopharyngeal microbes, such as streptococcus pneuomniae, Haemophilus influenze, and Neisseria meningitidis
					- Virulence factors:
						- They attach to the mucosa by means of fimbrae (for attachment)
						- They also overcome mucosal immunoglobins (IgA) via the secretion of protease
				- They are subjected to phagocytosis and then enter bloodstream.
				- After asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharyngeal microbe, there is a significant period of bacteremia
					- Virulence factors
						- The bacterial capsule, and LPS makes them anti-phagocytic, and effectively inhibits neutrophil phagocytosis.
						- They may also enter monocytes, which serves as a trojan horse into the subarachnoid space.
				- Prolonged bacteriemia provides an opportunity for the bacteria for extravastation into the subarachnoid space, crossing blood brain barrier by transcytosis.
				- Subsequently within the subarachnoid space, the bacteria replicates uncontrollably (as it lacks immunity due to low level of complements antibodies and WBC) (see components of CSF)
				- Bacterial cell wall and LPS activates TLR on endothelial cells and macrophages, resulting in release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1,6 and TNF)
				- This results in inflammation, resulting in oedema, and septic thrombosis.
				- The result is raised intracranial pressure, that prompts venous cerebral oedema
				- Septic thrombosis as well as the oedema results in cerebral ischaemia, and infarction.

						- Streptococcus agalactiae (group B)
						- Listeria monocytogenes
						- Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, Salmonella)
					- For 3 months to 18 years old, etiological agents involve those that have the propensity to colonise the nasopharyngeal mucosa
						- Streptococcus pneumoniae
						- Haemophilus influenzae type b
						- Neisseria meningitidis
					- For 18 to 50 year old, etiological agents include:
						- Streptococcus pneumoniae
						- Neisseria meningitidis
					- For >50 year old, they become susceptible to gram engative bacillis (Klebsiella, Escherichia and Salmonella)

			- [[Literature Notes]] Diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis is through abnormal CSF findings when performing a lumbar puncture
				- A lumbar puncture is often required for suspected meningitis, irrespective of etiology. It is the mainstay investigation for the diagnosis of meningitis.
				- Acute bacterial meningitis often result in:
					- Neutrophilic leukocytosis (cell count 1000 to 5000, in the thousands)
					- Less than 50% of blood glucose (Low CSF glucose levels)
					- High in protein
					- Turbid in apperance
					- Positive gram stain
				- Viral meningitis often results in:
					- Lymphocytic leukocytosis (cell count 50-100)
					- Glucose is usually normal
					- High in protein
					- Negative gram stain
				- Fungal or tuberculosis meningitis often results in:
					- Lymphocytic leukocytosis
					- Low CSF glucose levels
					- High protein
					- Negative gram stain
