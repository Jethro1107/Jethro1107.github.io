			- [[Literature Notes]] Within the infratemporal fossa, the branches of the 1st and 2nd part of the middle meningeal artery supply the cranial meninges, and contents within the infratemmporal fossa.
				- The maxillary artery is the largest branch of the external carotid artery, and provides a bulk of the blood supply to the nasal cavity, lateral walls and roof of the oral cavity, all teeth, the dura mater (especially that in the middle cranial fossa), and the contents within the infratemporal fossa.
				- Course
				  collapsed:: true
					- It originates within the substance of the parotid gland, as a terminal branch of the external carotid artery, passes through the infratemporal fossa, and through the pterygopalatine fossa where it gives terminal branches.
				- 3 parts of the maxillary artery
					- The 1st part of the maxillary artery is located between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of the mandible.
					- The 2nd part of the maxillary artery is located within the infratemporal fossa, and ascends obliquely towards the pterygomaxillary fissure.
					- The 3rd part of the maxillary artery is located within the pterygomaxillary fissure and passes into the pterygopalatine fossa.
				- Key branches of the maxillary artery
					- 1st part gives two key branches: the middle meningeal artery and the inferior alveolar artery.
						- Middle meningeal artery
							- It ascends up and accompanies the meningeal nerve to pass through the foramen spinosum into the middle cranial fossa.
						- Inferior alveolar artery
							- It descends between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of the mandible, accompanying the inferior alveolar nerve through the mandibular foramen into the mandibular canal.
					- 2nd part gives rise to: deep temporal artery, the pterygoid artery, masseteric artery, and buccal artery
						- They all accompany their corresponding nerves.

			- [[Literature Notes]] The pterygoid plexus is a venous plexus within the infratemporal fossa that provides venous drainage from the head and neck.
				- The pterygoid plexus is a network of veins that span between different layers within the infratemporal fossa, namely between the medial and lateral pyterygoid, and between the lateral pterygoid and the temporalis muscle.
				- Drainage
				  collapsed:: true
					- It drains anteriorly into the facial vein (via the inferior opthalmic vein and deep facial vein), and posteriorly, via a short maxillary vein that joins the retromandibular vein.
				- Tributaries
				  collapsed:: true
					- Its tributaries, provide venous drainage from nasal cavity, oral cavity, teeth, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, contents in infratemporal fossa.
				- It has emissary veins that pass through the roof of infratemporal fossa, communicating with the carvenous sinus.
				  collapsed:: true
					- This enables infections of the nasal cavity, oral cavity etc to spread via the pterygoid plexus and enter intracranially, resulting in a life-threatening condition called carvenous thrombosis.

				- The parotid region
					- The parotid region houses the parotid gland, the largest main salivary gland that is an inverted pyramid, wedged into the ramus of the mandible (covering the superficial, posterior and deep surface of the ramus of the mandible).
					- It drains saliva via the parotid duct
						- The parotid duct originates from the anterior border of the parotid glands, then courses anteriorly superficial to the masseter muscles, then pierces through the fat pads, and the temporal buccinator muscle and opens into the oral cavity in the vestibule, at the 2nd maxillary molar.
