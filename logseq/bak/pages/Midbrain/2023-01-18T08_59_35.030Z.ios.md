- Midbrain

- The midbrain (or **mesencephalon**) is the superior structure of the [[Brainstem]].

- Surface anatomy of the midbrain

- **Anterior features**
	 - Anteriorly, the midbrain is characterised by **cerebral peduncles** and the **interpeduncular fossa**, from which the [[Occulomotor nerve (CN III)]] emerges from.

- **Posterior features of the midbrain**
	 - Posteriorly, the midbrain is characterised by the **superior colliculus** and the **inferior colliculus**.
		 - The superior colliculus has vision and motor functions, while the inferior colliculus has hearing and motor functions.

	 - The [[Trochlear nerve (CN IV)|Trochlear nerve]] emerges inferior to the inferior colliculus, and is the only nerve that emerges posteriorly of the brainstem.

- Internal structures of the midbrain

- The midbrain is separated into 3 parts, which houses different structures:

- The dorsal **tectum**, consisting of the superior and inferior colliculus

- The ventral **tegmentum**

- The tegmentum is further surrounded by masses of descending fibre system, known as the **cerebral peduncle**

- Tectum

- Tegmentum

- The tegmentum houses various structures:

- Ascending pathways

- Dorsolaterally, the medial meniscus of the [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]] ascends in an oblique plane.

- Dorsal to the medial lemniscus would be the spinal lamniscus

- Most dorsally, is the lateral lemniscus, which terminates at the inferior colliculus.

- Substantia niagra

- The [[Substantia niagra]], part of the [[Basal ganglia]], is located just dorsal to the [[#Cerebral peduncle]], and houses dopaminergic neurons, protruding to the striatum of the basal ganglia.

- Red nucleus

- The red nucleus is located dorsomedial to the substantial niagra, and is associated with motor functions.

- Cranial nerve nuclei

- The main occulomotor nucleus ([[Occulomotor nerve (CN III)]]) is located anterior to the periaqueductal gray medially, at the *level of the superior colliculus*.

- The Edinger Westphal nucleus is located between the two main occulomotor nucleus.

- The trochlear nucleus ([[Trochlear nerve (CN IV)]]) is located anterior to the periaqueductal gray medially, inferior to the main occulomotor nucleus, at the *level of the inferior colliculus*.

- Cerebral aqueduct

- The cerebral aqueduct is located dorsally in the tegmentum of the midbrain, and is surrouded by **periaqueductal gray**. It *drains cerebrospinal fluid from the 3rd ventricle to the 4th ventricle* ([[Cerebrospinal fluid pathway|CSF pathway]]).

- Cerebral peduncle

- The cerebral peduncle houses various descending tracts:

- The corticobulbar tract

- The corticospinal tract is located in the middle

- The corticopontine tract
