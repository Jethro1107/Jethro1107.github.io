- ### The infratemporal fossa is the space between the pharynx and the ramus of the mandible
  collapsed:: true
	- The infratemporal fossa is a very narrow space between the pharynx and the ramus of the mandible, inferior to the zygomatic arch, yet contains various key structures.
	- ### Boundaries of the infratemporal fossa
	  collapsed:: true
		- The bony framework of the infratemporal fossa is roughly formed by parts of the [[Sphenoid bone]], [[Temporal bone]], [[Maxilla]], and the ramus of the [[Mandible]]. It is also bounded by various muscles.
		- On each surface, it is characterised by foramina or fissures, that enables the infratemporal fossa to be continuous with various spaces in the body,
		- **Roof**
		  collapsed:: true
		  id:: 63b8cd7f-c270-49fd-b145-4f910e85d90f
			- The roof of the infratemporal fossa is formed by the **infratemporal surfaces** of greater wing of the [[Sphenoid bone]] and the [[Temporal bone]].
			- Through the *inferior surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone*, it houses foramina that enables communication between the infratemporal fossa and the cranial cavity, particularly the **middle cranial fossa** ([[The cranial base is is separated into three cranial fossas]]).
			  collapsed:: true
				- The foramen ovale (anteriorly) - enables the mandibular nerve to drop through.
				- The foramen spinosum (posteriorly) - enables the passage of the middle meningeal artery and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve.

		- **Anterior wall**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Anterior wall of the anterior wall of infratemporal fossa is formed by the posterior surface of the maxilla.
			- It is characterised by the **alveolar foramina** for the passage of the *posterosuperior alveolar nerve and vessels*.
			- It also forms the superior margin for the **inferior orbital fissure**, for the passage of *infraorbital nerve and vessels, zygomatic branch of maxillary nerve, and opthalmic vein*.

		- **Medial wall**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The medial wall of the infratemporal fossa is formed by the lateral pterygoid plate and the greater wing of the [[Sphenoid bone]], anteriorly, the ((63b385a4-ea79-4057-a2ea-d9ade67b7c0e)), and the ((63b385a4-63b1-49da-9f55-b314338ffcd4)), as well as the ((63b39ceb-d2df-48ee-a669-7f2b083f9a29)) , part of the lateral wall of the [[Pharynx]].
			- It consists of the pterygomaxillary fissure, which houses the pterygopalatine ganglion and the is continuous with the pterygopalatine fossa.

		- **Lateral wall of the infratemporal fossa**
		  id:: 63b7faef-ca79-4800-b32b-32ae277d40ab
		  collapsed:: true
			- The lateral wall of the infratemporal fossa is formed by the medial surface ramus of the [[Mandible]] .
			- On its medial surface, it is characterised by the **mandibular foramen**, which is the superior opening of the mandibular canal, guarded by a triangular elevation called the **lingula**.
