- ### Bony framework of the roof, floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity
  collapsed:: true
	- **Roof of the nasal cavity**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Much of the roof of the nasal cavity is formed by the cribiform plate of the [[Ethmoid bone]].
		- Anterior to the cribiform plate, it is contributed by the **nasal spine** of the [[Frontal bone]], the [[Nasal bones]], and the **lateral process of the septal cartilage**.
		- Posterior to the cribiform plate, it is formed by the body of the [[Sphenoid bone]], ala of [[Vomer]], sphenoidal process of the [[Palatine bone]], and the medial pterygoid plate of the [[Sphenoid bone]].

	- **Floor of the nasal cavity**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The floor of the nasal cavity is formed by the superior surface of the [[Hard palate]].
	- **Lateral wall of the nasal cavity**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The lateral wall of the nasal cavity consist of shelf-like extensions called **conchae**, which overlie the corresponding **meatus**.
		- It is formed by:
		  collapsed:: true
			- The *ethmoid labyrinth, superior conchae, and inferior conchae* of the [[Ethmoid bone]] superiorly.
			- The Inferior conchae inferiorly.
			- The medial end of the [[Maxilla]] and [[Lacrimal bone]] anteriorly.
			- The perpendicular plate of the [[Palatine bone]], and the medial pterygoid plate of the [[Sphenoid bone]] posteriorly.
