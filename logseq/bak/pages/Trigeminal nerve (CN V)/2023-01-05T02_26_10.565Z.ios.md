- Trigeminal nerve (CN V)
- The trigeminal nerve (CN V) has both somatic sensory and branchial motor functions.
- Trigeminal nerve nuclei
- There are 4 trigeminal nerve nuclei:
- **Pontine trigeminal nuclei** (principal trigeminal nuclei/ main sensory nuclei)
	- The pontine trigeminal nuclei (a sensory nuclei) is found dorsally in the caudal [[Pons]], and is continuous inferiorly as the spinal trigeminal nuclei and superiorly as the mesencephalic trigeminal nuclei.
	- It is located lateral to the trigeminal motor nuclei.
- **Spinal trigeminal nuclei**
	- The spinal trigeminal nuclei is *located dorsolaterally*, and extends through the entire [[Medulla]], and into the caudal part of the spinal cord, as much as up to the 2nd cervical segment.
- **Mesencephalic trigeminal nuclei**
	- The mesencephalic trigeminal nuclei is a column of **unipolar cells** *located in the lateral part of the periaqueductal gray of the [[Midbrain]]*.
- **Trigeminal motor nuclei**
	- The trigeminal motor nuclei is situated medial to the main sensory nucleus.

- Somatic sensory component of trigeminal nerve
- Somatosensory impulses from the skin and mucous membrane of the face pass through peripheral axons through the branches of trigeminal nerve towards the **trigeminal ganglion**, and via the central process enters the pons.
- Within the pons, some branches into ascending and descending branches, where the ascending branch synapse with the 2nd order neurons within the **pontine trigeminal nucleus**, and the descending branch synapse with the 2nd order neurons within the **spinal trigeminal nucleus**.
- Kind of counterintuitively, the sensory fibres from the opthalmic division project to the inferior part of the spinal trigeminal tract, the maxillary division to the middle part, and the mandibular division to the superior part.
- *Proprioceptive impulses** from muscles of mastication, [[Temporomandibular joint]], peridontal membrane and external ocular muscles project via the peripheral axons, bypassing the trigeminal ganglion, into the **mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus** (these fibres arise from the unipolar cells of these nucleus).
- Axons from the 2nd order neurons of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, pontine trigeminal nucleus, and the central axon from the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus project via the [[Trigeminothalamic tract]] to the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus.

- Branchial motor component of trigeminal nerve
- The **trigeminal motor nucleus** receives cortical command via the [[Corticobulbar tract]] , and sends axons through the motor root.
- Motor fibres all pass through the mandibular division, and provides motor supply to:
- The muscles of mastication: temporalis, masseter, tensor tympani, tensor veli palateni, anterior belly of digastric muscle, and myohyoid muscles.
- Course of trigeminal nerve
- The trigeminal nerve emerges from the **anterior surface of the [[Pons]]**, as a *large sensory root and a small motor root*.
- The trigeminal nerve passes anteriorly from the posterior cranial fossa into the middle cranial fossa.
- The sensory root expands into a crescent-shaped **trigeminal ganglion**, which divides into the 3 divisions of the trigeminal nerve:
- The **Opthalmic division (V1)** consists of only sensory fibres, and leaves the cranial cavity through the superior opthalmic fissure (between the two wings of the [[Ethmoid bone]]).
- The **Maxillary division (V2)** consists of only sensory fibres, and leaves the cranial cavity through the foramen rotundum.
- The **Mandibular division (V3)** consists of both sensory and motor fibres, and leave the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale of the [[Sphenoid bone]].
