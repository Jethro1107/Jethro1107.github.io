- External carotid artery
- The external carotid artery is a terminal branch of the [[Common carotid artery]].
- Branches of the external carotid arteries and its supply
- The external carotid artery has 8 branches, *3 anterior branches, 3 posterior branches and 2 terminal branches*.
- Anterior branches
  id:: 63b385b6-8c63-472d-97b8-c9072812148f
- The 3 anterior branches are the **superior thyroid artery**, **lingual artery** and the **facial artery**.
- **Superior thyroid artery**
	- The superior thyroid artery is the 1st anterior branch of the external carotid artery.
	- It passes anteriorly and inferiorly to supply the superior pole of the [[Thyroid gland]].
- **Lingual artery**
	- The lingual artery is the 2nd anterior branch of the external carotid artery.
	- It passes anteriorly, deep to the [[Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)]], and passes between the hypoglossus and middle pharyngeal constrinctor to supply the tongue.
- **[[Facial artery]]**
  id:: 63b385b6-c82e-4ef1-88ac-263d662ff10e
	- ((63b40397-84d7-468c-b1d5-c132b39cc77f))
	- ((63b40407-0fbb-4cc9-829c-e37f1abc18a7))
- Posterior branches
- The 3 posterior branches are the **ascending pharyngeal artery**, **occipital artery** and the **posterior auricular artery**.
- **Ascending pharyngeal artery**
	- The ascending pharyngeal artery is the 1st posterior branch of the common carotid artery.
	- It ascends medially, between the [[Internal carotid artery]] and the pharynx, supplying the pharynx.
- **Occipital artery**
	- The occipital artery is the 2nd posterior branch of the common carotid artery, and is found near the level of the [[#^5540bc|Facial artery]].
	- It ascends posteriorly and *passes deep to the posterior belly of digastric muscles*, and runs to the occipital protuberance of the [[Occipital bone]].
- **Posterior auricular artery**
	- The posterior auricular artery is the final posterior branch of the common carotid artery.
	- It ascends posteriorly between the external acoustic meatus opening and the mastoid process of the [[Temporal bone]].
- Terminal branches
- The two terminal branches are the **maxillary artery** and the **superficial temporal artery**.
  id:: 63b28d00-d180-45e9-8737-dd323e90ce3d
- [[Maxillary artery]]
	- The maxillary artery is the larger terminal branch.
	- It passes deep to the neck of the [[Mandible]], through the [[Parotid glands]], into the [[Infratemporal fossa]], and eventually pass through the [[Pterygopalatine fossa]].
- **Superficial temporal artery**
  id:: 63b28d00-950e-4b0b-a2c4-c513d0337cc8
	- The superior temporal artery is the smaller terminal branch.
	- It passes superiorly, *over the zygomatic process of the [[Temporal bone]]* into the temporal region, and divides into an anterior and posterior branch.
