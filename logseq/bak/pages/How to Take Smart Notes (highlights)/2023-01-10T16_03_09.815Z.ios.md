	 - Luhmann managed to beat Trollope in productivity if you count his articles as well as his books. Luhmann wrote 58 books and hundreds of articles, while Trollope wrote 47 novels plus 16 other books. Granted, it might have something to do with the fact that Luhmann did some work after breakfast as well. But the main reason is the slip-box, which compares to Trollope’s technique as investing with compounded interest compares to a piggy-bank. Trollope is like a diligent saver who puts a little sum to the side every day, which adds up over time toward something impressive. Three dollars put aside each day (say, one takeout coffee) add up over the year to a small vacation ($1,000) and over a working life to a deposit on a flat as a permanent holiday retreat.[31] Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest (which would in this example almost pay for the whole flat).[32] ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1710))

		 - **Note**: Trollope set aside time to write before breakfast, writing a couple pages of his novel everyday. In a sense, his commitment to writing fares with Luhmann’s. But Luhmann was able to be more productive due to the way he writes, i.e. his note taking system.

	 - Luhmann states as clearly as possible: it is not possible to think systematically without writing (Luhmann 1992, 53). Most people still think about thinking as a purely internal process, and believe that the only function of the pen is to put finished thoughts on paper.

	 - The literature notes are going to be archived, which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn’t do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas.

	 - If we instead focus on “retrieval strength,” we instantly start to think strategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory. There are no natural cues: Every piece ([Location 1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1877))
		 - **Note**: When neurons fire together, they wire together. When a note is linked extensively to a large number of notes, resurfacing of any number of these notes would allow us to retrieve the original note.

	 - of information can become the trigger for another piece of information. ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1878))

	 - Stein et al. illustrate how commonsensical this is on the example of a biology novice who learns the difference between veins and arteries: “[he] may find it difficult at first to understand and remember that arteries have thick walls, are elastic, and do not have valves, whereas veins are less elastic, have thinner walls, and have valves” (ibid.). But by elaborating a little bit on this difference and asking the right questions, like “why?” the students can connect this knowledge with prior knowledge, like their understanding of pressure and the function of the heart. Just by making the connection to the common knowledge that the heart presses the blood into the arteries, they immediately know that these walls need to sustain more pressure, which means they need to be thicker than veins, in which the blood flows back to the heart with less pressure. And, of course, this makes valves necessary to keep the blood from flowing back. Once understood, the attributes and differences are almost impossible to disentangle from the knowledge of veins and arteries.

	 - Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2046))
