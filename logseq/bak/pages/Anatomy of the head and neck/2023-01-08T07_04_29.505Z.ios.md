			- Innervation of the face
			  collapsed:: true
				- #[[Sensory innervation of the face]] [[Branches of the trigeminal nerve provide sensory innervation to the face]]
				- #[[Motor innervation]] [[Branches of facial nerve innervate the muscles of facial expression]]

			- Vascular supply of the face
			  collapsed:: true
				- Arterial supply of the face is mainly supplied by the [[Facial artery]], a branch of [[External carotid artery]].
				- The face is also supplied by the transverse facial artery, a branch of the ((63b28d00-950e-4b0b-a2c4-c513d0337cc8)) .

				- #Innervation [[As the mandibular nerve drops into the infratemporal fossa, it branches into various nerves that provide sensory and motor innervation to various structures]]
				- #[[Maxillary artery]] [[The branches of the 1st and 2nd part of the maxillary artery supplies the infratemporal fossa and various regions of the head and neck]]
				- #[[Pterygoid plexus]] [[The pterygoid plexus is a venous plexus within the infratemporal fossa that provides venous drainage from various regions of the head and neck, including the infratemporal fossa itself]]

		- Nose
		  collapsed:: true
			- The nose is a key feature of the frace, and encloses what is called the [[Nasal cavity]].
			- A osteocartiligeous framework enclose the nasal cavity. [[The external nose skeleton forms the anterior part of the nasal cavity]], and is highly variable in nature. The [[The nasal septum is an osteocartilaginous structure that separates the two nasal cavities|Nasal septum]] forms the medial wall of the nasal cavity, and separates the two nasal cavity. Various bones of the [[Cranium]] also contribute to the [[Bony framework of the roof, floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity]].
