	  collapsed:: true
		- [[Posterior triangle of the neck]]
		- [[Anterior triangle of the neck]]
	- ### Arterial supply of the head and neck

		- Face
		  collapsed:: true
			- [[Muscles of facial expression]]
			- Innervation of the face
			  collapsed:: true
				- Sensory: [[Branches of the trigeminal nerve provide sensory innervation to the face]]
				- Motor: [[Branches of facial nerve innervate the muscles of facial expression]]
			- Vascular supply of the face
			  collapsed:: true
				- Arterial supply of the face is mainly supplied by the [[Facial artery]], a branch of [[External carotid artery]].
				- The face is also supplied by the transverse facial artery, a branch of the ((63b28d00-950e-4b0b-a2c4-c513d0337cc8)) .

The [[The nasal septum is an osteocartilaginous structure that separates the two nasal cavities|Nasal septum]] forms the medial wall of the nasal cavity, and separates the two nasal cavity. Various bones of the [[Cranium]] also contribute to the [[Bony framework of the roof, floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity]].
