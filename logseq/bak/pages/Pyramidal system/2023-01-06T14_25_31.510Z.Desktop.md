- # Pyramidal system
  collapsed:: true
	- The pyramidal system involves in the transmission of *descending motor signals* from the primary [[Motor cortex]] to the muscles. (Direct command of muscles)
	- The pyramidal system involves the corticospinal tract (to the limbs and trunks), and the corticobulbar tract (to the head and neck).
	- ### Origin of the pyramidal tract
	  collapsed:: true
		- The pyramidal tract originates from **pyramidal cells** of layer V in the primary motor cortex, which are the upper motor neurons that sends axons down either the corticospinal tract, and the corticobulbar tract.

	- ### Course of the corticospinal tract
	  collapsed:: true
		- Corticospinal tract can be considered as the pyramidal tract for the
		- The pyramidal cells (upper motor neurons) *responsible for limbs and trunk* (refering to the [[The motor homunculus roughly deleniates a map of repertoires of movement in the primary motor cortex|Motor homunculus]]) sends axons that pass through the **corona radiata** (crown-shaped radiation), in a twisting manner, as it converges into the [[Internal capsule]].
		- Within the internal capsule, axons are arranged in a manner that it houses axons to the lower limb posteriorly, and that for the upper limb anteriorly.

		- The axons then descend through the **cerebral peduncle** of the [[Midbrain]], through the **pontine trigeminal nucleus** of the [[Pons]], and into the **medullary pyramids** in the [[Medulla]].
		- Decussation
		  collapsed:: true
			- A large portion of the fibres (80%) decussate at the **pyramidal decussation** and descend along the contralateral **lateral corticospinal tract**.
			- The remaining fibres descend along the ipsilateral **anterior corticospinal tract**, and eventually *decussate at the spinal level*.
			- It should be noted that the fibres that decussate at the pyramidal decussation generally supply the distal muscles, while those that decussate at the spinal level supply proximal muscles, and the trunk.

			- It subsequently synapse with lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord ([[Physiological anatomy of the spinal cord]]), which supplies the muscles.
	- ### Course of corticobulbar tract
	  collapsed:: true
		- Corticobulbar tract can be considered as the pyramidal tract of the head and neck.
		- Pyramidal cells (upper motor neurons) responsible for head and neck functions descends along the corona radiata and [[Internal capsule]], and the cerebral peduncles.
		- Within the [[Brainstem]], the axons synapse with the lower motor neurons within cranial nerve nuclei, which then supplies the muscles through various cranial nerves:
		  collapsed:: true
			- [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]]
			- [[Facial neve (CNVII)]]
			- Glossopharyngeal enrve
			- Vagus nerve
			- Spinal accessory nerve
			- Hypoglossal nerve
		- Most cranial nerve nuclei are supplied by the cotralateral and ipsilateral corticobulbar tract, such *defects in one side can be compensated by the other side*.
		  collapsed:: true
			- This is with the exception of:
			  collapsed:: true
				- The lower fascial nucleus for fascial nerve
				- The hypoglossal nucleus for the hypoglossal nerve
				- This underlies the various manifestations of [[Fascial nerve palsy]], and [[Hypoglossal palsy]].
