- # Muscles of facial expression
	- ### Key features of muscles of facial expression
		- Muscles of facial expression are a special kind of skeletal muscles, as they are *found in the superficial fascia (subcutaneous tissue) under the skin of the head and neck*. Hence, they are all *not covered by deep fascia*, with the exception of the Buccinator.
		- They originate from the bones or fascia, and insert onto the skin.
		- They are all derived from the **secondary pharyngeal arch.**
		- Muscles of facial expression are innervated by the [Facial nerve]([[Facial neve (CNVII)]]).
	- ### Functions of muscles of facial expression
		- 1. They serve as sphincters and dilators of facial orifices
		- 2. They protect facial orifices
		- 3. They support ingestion, sound production and swallowing
		- 4. They support **facial expression**
