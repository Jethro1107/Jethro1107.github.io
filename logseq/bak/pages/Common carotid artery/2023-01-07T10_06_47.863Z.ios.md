- Common carotid artery
- The much of the vascular supply of the head and neck is provided by the common carotid artery.
- Course of the common carotid artery
- The left common carotid artery is a direct branch of the aortic arch, while the right common carotid artery is a branch of the brachiocephalic artery.
- The common carotid artery ascends through the [[Carotid sheath]] in the neck, and subsequently give two terminal branch.
- Branch of the common carotid artery
- The common carotid artery bifurcates into two terminal branches, the [[Internal carotid artery]] and the [[External carotid artery]]. The most distal part of the carotid artery, parts of the internal and external carotid artery can be found the [[Anterior triangle of the neck#Carotid triangle|Carotid triangle]], a subdivision of the [[Anterior triangle of the neck]].
- Two specialised organs can be found at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery
- The **carotid bodies** and the **carotid sinus** are *specialised organs for homeostatic functions* found at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery:
- Carotid body
- The carotid body can be found at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, *embedded in the tunica adventitia of the vessel*.
- It houses **peripheral chemoreceptors** responsible for the [[Chemoreceptor reflex]].
- Carotid sinus
- The carotid sinus is a dilated portion of the internal carotid artery (or the distal part of common carotid artery) near the bifurcation.
- It houses **baroreceptors** responsible for detecting changes in blood pressure and initiating the [[Baroreceptor reflex]].
