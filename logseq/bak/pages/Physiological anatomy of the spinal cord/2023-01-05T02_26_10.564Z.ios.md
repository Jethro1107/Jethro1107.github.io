- Physiological anatomy of the spinal cord
- The spinal cord is characterised with an inner H-shaped gray matter region, which consist of cell bodies, and an outer white matter region, which consist of the axons.
- Gray matter
- The gray matter is roughy and H-shaped (butterfly-shaped structure) that has several horns.
- Ventral (anterior) horn
- The ventral horn consists of large (almost visible on light microscopy) alpha motor neurons.
- The alpha motor neurons for the distal muscles is located laterally, while the alpha motor neurons for axial and proximal muscles is located anteriorly, such that they are accessible easily by the lateral and anterior [[Pyramidal system|Corticospinal tract]] respectively.
- Dorsal horn
- The dorsal horn houses second order neurons for the ascending [[Spinothalamic pathway]], responsible for light touch, pain sensation and temperature.
- Lateral horn
- The lateral horn is only present from T1 to L2 spinal levels, as the *sympathetic nervous system has thoracolumbar outflow*.
- The lateral horn houses **preganglionic sympathetic neurons**.
- White matter
- The white matter region can be classified into descending tracts and ascending tracts.
- Descending tracts
- Descending tracts can be found in lateral funiculus and ventral funiculus.

- Rubrospinal tract
- Lateral reticulospinal tract
- Medial reticulospinal tract
- Vestibulospinal tract
- Tectospinal tract

- Ascending tract
- Dorsal column
- The key ascending tract is the dorsal column (part of the [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]]), and is responsible for discriminatory touch.
- The organisations is as follow: 1st order neurons from sacral region is located most medially, followed by lumbar, followed by thoracic, and cervical region most laterally.
- Two columns are present, the medial **gracile fasciculus** and the lateral **cuneate fasciculus** (which arise at T6).
- Lateral [[Spinothalamic pathway|Spinothalamic tract]]
- Ventral Spinothalamic tract
