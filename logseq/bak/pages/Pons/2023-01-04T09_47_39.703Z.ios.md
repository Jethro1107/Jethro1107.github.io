- Pons

- The pons is the middle structure of the [[Brainstem]].

- Surface anatomy of the Pons

- **Anterior features**
	 - Anteriorly, the pons is characterised by the **trigeminal nerve**.

	 - The basillary sulcus is also present, in association with [[Brain circulation#^20aa22|Basillary artery]].

- **Posterior features**
	 - Posteriorly, the pons is characterised by the **superior cerebellar peduncle** and the **middle cerebellar peduncle**.

- The pons forms parts of the floor of the 4th ventricle. [[The rhomboid fossa bears various features that reveals the internal structure of the medulla and pons]].

- Internal structures of the Pons

- The pons is divided into a ventral side (basal side) and a dorsal side (tegmental side), which is divided by the dorsally displaced, horizontally arranged medial lamniscus.

- Basal part of the pons

- The pontine nucleus is present in the ventral part of the pons. Many fibres pass through the pontine nucleus:

- Dorsally, the transversely arranged **pontocerebellar fibres** are found.

- Ventrally, the descending **corticospinal tract** is found.

- Tegmental part of the pons

- The tegmental part of the pons is characterised by various cranial nerve nuclei.

- In the lower pons, the fascial nucleus is located laterally and the abducens nucleus is located medially.

- In the upper pons, the trochlear nucleus is located medialy.

- Descending pathways

- Ventrally, patchy bundles of corticospinal tract descend through the pontine trigeminal nucleus of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]].

- Ascending pathways

- [[Dorsal column medial lamniscus pathway]] - The medial lamniscus ascends dorsally, in a horizontal plane.

- Cranial nerve nuclei

- Ventrally, the pontine nucleus is present.

- At the lower pons, the nucleus of the fascial nerve is located laterally, and the abducens nucleus is located medially.

- At the upper pons, the trochlear nucleus is located medially.
