- Facial neve (CNVII)

- Facial nerve nuclei

- There are 3 main facial nerve nuclei:

- **Facial nucleus** (main motor nucleus)
	 - The facial nucleus is found within the caudal [[Pons]] dorsolaterally, deep to the reticular formation.

- **Superior salivary nucleus**
	 - The superior salivary nucleus is located dorsolateral to the fascial nucleus of the pons.

- **Rostral part of nucleus tractus solitarii**
	 - The nucleus tractus solitarii is closely associated with the motor main motor nucleus.

- Branchial motor components of the facial nerve

- Facial nucleus (main motor nucleus) receives cortical command from the [[Pyramidal system|Corticobulbar tract]]:

- The upper facial nucleus is supplied by both the contralateral and ipsilateral corticobulbar tract,

- The lower facial nucleus is only supplied by the the contralateral corticobulbar tract (which results in the classical presentation of central [[Fascial nerve palsy]]).

- The facial nucleus sends axons that travel through the motor root of the facial nerve to supply the **[[muscles of facial expression]]**.

- Visceral motor (parasympathetic) components of the facial nerve

- The superior salivatory nucleus houses **preganglionic parasympathetic neurons** responsible for nasal secretion, lacrimal secretion, and salivary secretion by the submandibular and sublingual glands.

- For nasal and lacrimal secretions, preganglionic fibres pass through the **major petrosal nerve** to the **nerve of pterygoid canal** and synapse at the **pterygopalatine ganglion**. The postganglionic ganglionic neuron then sends axon via **maxillary nerve** to the lacrimal gland and mucosal gland of nasal cavity and palate.

- For salivary secretion, preganglionic fibres pass through the **chorda tympani**, hitch hike via the **lingual nerve**, and synapse at the **submandibular ganglion**. Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons then send axons to supply the submandibular glands and sublingual glands.

- Special sensory componenents of the facial nerve

- Nerve endings at taste buds of the *anterior 2/3 of the tongue* travel pass via the geniculate ganglion, and subsequently synapse at the **nucleus tractus solitarii**.

- Somatic sensory component of the facial nerve

- Somatosensory impulse of the **posterior auricular region** travel via the geniculate ganglion, and subsequently synapse at the caudal part of the **spinal trigeminal nucleus**.

- Course of the facial nerve

- The facial nerve emerges from the junction between the [[Pons]] and [[Medulla]] at the cerebropontine angle.

- It has a motor root, and a sensory root (intermediate nerve).
