- # The 4 muscles of mastication enable movement at the temporomandibular joint
  collapsed:: true
	- There are 4 muscles of mastication, which is closely located near the [[Infratemporal fossa]]. The masseter and the temporalis is *located in close association to the region*, while the medial and lateral pterygoid are *located within the region*.
	- **Masseter**
	  id:: 63b8df26-982b-4ba2-813d-959a0dbdc7ca
	  collapsed:: true
		- The masseter is a quadrangular muscle, and the most powerful muscle of mastication.
		- It originates from the zygomatic arch and the maxillary process of the [[Zygomatic bone]], and inserts onto the lateral side of the ramus of the mandible.
		- **Movements of the masseter**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The masseter is the **main elevator** of the mandible, enabling the *biting-down action*.

	- **Temporalis**
	  id:: 63b8f46d-a044-4ed1-8a38-a671d8f70f85
	  collapsed:: true
		- The temporalis is a large fan-shaped muscle that occupies the entire temporal fossa.
		- It originates from the temporal fossa, and consist of anterior fibres coursing vertically, and posterior fibres coursing horizontally, which converge into a single tendon on the **coronoid process** of the [[Mandible]].
		- **Movements of the temporalis**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The temporalis serves as a major elevator.
			- Posterior fibres also retracts the mandible.
			- It also offers some side-to-side movement.

	- **Medial pterygoid**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The medial pterygoid, is a quadrangular muscle, and as its name implies is located medial to the lateral pterygoid.
		- It originates from two heads:
		  collapsed:: true
			- The deep head originates from the lateral pterygoid plate of the [[Sphenoid bone]].
			- The superficial head originates from the maxillary tuberosity, and the pyramidal process of the palatine bone.
		- It inserts onto the medial surface of the mandible, near the angle of the [[Mandible]].
		- **Movements of the medial pterygoid**
		  collapsed:: true
			- The medial pterygoid *elevates, protracts and moves the mandible medially*.
	- **Lateral pterygoid**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The lateral pterygoid is a triangular muscle, and as its name implies, is located lateral to the medial pterygoid within the infratemporal fossa.
		- It originates from two heads:
		  collapsed:: true
			- The upper head originates from the ((63b8cd7f-c270-49fd-b145-4f910e85d90f)) of the infratemporal fossa, particularly the greater wing of the sphenoid bone.
			- The lower head origiantes from the lateral pterygoid plate, lying between the two heads of the sphenoid bone.
		- The two heads converge into a single muscle belly and inserts onto the neck of the mandible, and the joint capsule of the [[Temporomandibular joint]].
		- **Movements of the lateral pterygoid**
		  collapsed:: true
			- It is the main protruder, and moves the mandible medially.
