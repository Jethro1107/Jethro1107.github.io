- # Pain modulation by 2 pathways
  collapsed:: true
	- There are 2 pathways by which we reduce pain sensation: 1) **Descending pain modulatory pathway**, and 2) **Gate control theory**.
	- ### Descending pain modulatory pathway activates the spinal opiate system
	  collapsed:: true
		- Higher centres stimulate the [[Midbrain]] periaqueductal gray, which stimulates the medial **nucleus raphne magnus** of the medulla oblongata, which houses serotinergic neurons.
		- The nucleus raphne magnus produces serotinergic projections through the medulla to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
		- The **locus cereleus nucleus** located dorsolaterally of the [[Pons]] houses noradrenergic neurons, which project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
		- **Serotonin and noradrenaline activate an opiate system at the spinal level**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Serotonin and noradrenaline activates interneurons, which release enkephalin, which has effects at the presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic terminal.
			- At the presynaptic terminal, it inhibits the release of glutamate and substance P.
			- At the postsynaptic terminal, it causes hyperpolarization of the 2nd order neurons.
			- This blocks relay of pain signals from the Type A-delta fibres and type C fibres to 2nd order neurons of the spinal cord.

	- ### Gate control theory describes lateral inhibition of pain signals by simutaneous tactile sensory signals
	  collapsed:: true
		- Type A alpha or beta fibres from various [Tactile receptors](((63b38605-65e0-4680-8d31-4d353bed6b4e))) may result in lateral inhibition, by activation of inhibitory neurons that inhibit 2nd order neurons of the [Pain pathway]([[Pain and the pain pathway]]).
		- This is why rubbing the skin near painful area can result in pain relief.
