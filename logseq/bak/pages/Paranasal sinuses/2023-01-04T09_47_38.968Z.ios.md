- Paranasal sinuses

- There are 4 paranasal sinuses, *named corresponding to the respective bones they are found in*.

- Frontal sinus

- The frontal sinus is a roughly triangular sinus that is located within the [[Frontal bone]].

- It drains via the **frontonasal duct**, which passes through the ethmoid labyrinth, into the **ethmoidal infundibulum**, which opens at the **hiatus semilunaris**, *located in the middle meatus nasal cavity, inferior to the ethmoidal bullae*.

- Maxillary sinus

- The maxillary sinus is the *largest paranasal sinus*, located on either side of the [[Maxilla]].

- The maxillary sinus opens directly into the floor of the **hiatus semilunaris**.

- Ethmoid cells

- Ethmoid cells are located in the ethmoidal labyrinth of the [[Ethmoid bone]], which are individual air chambers withinthe labyrinth.

- The ethmoid cells are divided into the *anterior, middle and posterior ethmoid cells*, which drain into the ethmoid cells in different ways:

- The anterior ethmoid cells drain into the ethmoid infundibulum or frontonasal duct

- The middle ethmoid cells drain into apertures on the surface of the **ethmoidal bullae**

- The posterior ethmoid cells drain into apertures in the superior meatus

- Sphenoid sinus

- Sphenoid sinus is is found on either side of the body of the [[Sphenoid bone]].

- It drains through apertures on the posterior wall of the **sphenoethmoidal recess** (superior to the superior conchae).

- Function of paranasal sinuses

- Paranasal sinuses facilitate in filtering the incoming air, as well as resonating voice.

- Innervation of paranasal sinuses

- They are innervated by the opthalmic and maxillary divisions of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)|Trigeminal nerve]] (V1 and V2).

- Blood supply of paranasal sinuses

- They are supplied by:

- Branches of the opthalmic artery (branch of [[Internal carotid artery]])

- Branches of [[Maxillary artery]]
