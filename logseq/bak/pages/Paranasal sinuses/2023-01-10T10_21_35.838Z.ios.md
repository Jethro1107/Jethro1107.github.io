- ### Paranasal sinuses
	- There are 4 paranasal sinuses, *named corresponding to the respective bones they are found in*.

	- **Frontal sinus**
		- The frontal sinus is a roughly triangular sinus that is located within the [[Frontal bone]].
		- It drains via the **frontonasal duct**, which passes through the ethmoid labyrinth, into the **ethmoidal infundibulum**, which opens at the **hiatus semilunaris**, *located in the middle meatus nasal cavity, inferior to the ethmoidal bullae*.

	- **Maxillary sinus**
		- The maxillary sinus is the *largest paranasal sinus*, located on either side of the [[Maxilla]].
		- The maxillary sinus opens directly into the floor of the **hiatus semilunaris**.
	- **Ethmoid cells**
		- Ethmoid cells are located in the ethmoidal labyrinth of the [[Ethmoid bone]], which are individual air chambers withinthe labyrinth.
		- The ethmoid cells are divided into the *anterior, middle and posterior ethmoid cells*, which drain into the ethmoid cells in different ways:
			- The anterior ethmoid cells drain into the ethmoid infundibulum or frontonasal duct
			- The middle ethmoid cells drain into apertures on the surface of the **ethmoidal bullae**
			- The posterior ethmoid cells drain into apertures in the superior meatus

- **Sphenoid sinus**
	- Sphenoid sinus is is found on either side of the body of the [[Sphenoid bone]].
	- It drains through apertures on the posterior wall of the **sphenoethmoidal recess** (superior to the superior conchae).

	- **Function of paranasal sinuses**
		- Paranasal sinuses facilitate in filtering the incoming air, as well as resonating voice.
	- **Innervation of paranasal sinuses**
		- They are innervated by the opthalmic and maxillary divisions of [[Trigeminal nerve (CN V)]] (V1 and V2).
	- **Blood supply of paranasal sinuses**
		- They are supplied by:
			- Branches of the opthalmic artery (branch of [[Internal carotid artery]])
			- Branches of [[Maxillary artery]]
