- ### The external nose skeleton forms the anterior part of the nasal cavity
	- The external nose skeleton forms the anterior part of the nasal cavity, and as a result provides the shape of the nose.
	- **The external nose skeleton is formed by bones and cartilage**
		- Superiorly, it is marked by the paired [[Nasal bones]].
		- Inferiorly, it is marked by the septal cartilage (which forms much of the anterior surface part of the [[Nasal septum]]):
		- The septal cartilage attaches inferiorly to the **anterior nasal spine** of the [[Maxilla]].
		- The septal cartilage expands laterally to give the **lateral process of the septal cartilage**.
		- Inferiorly, it is also marked by the **major and minor alar cartilage**, and the alar fibrofatty tissue lateral of the nares.
		- Due to variations in the cartilage of the external nose skeleton, the *external appearance of nose varies considerably*.
