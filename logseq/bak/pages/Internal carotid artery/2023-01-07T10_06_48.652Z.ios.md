- 4 parts of the internal carotid artery
- *Cervical part** - The cervical part extends from the level of bifurcation to the [[Temporal bone]].
- *Petrous part** - The petrous part is the part that passes through the *carotid canal of the petrous part of the temporal bone*.
- *Carvenous part** - The carvenous part is an S-shaped part that extends through the [[Carveneous sinus]], and pierces the dura mater.
- *Cerebral part** - The cerebral part is the part that passes posterior along the midline  towards the lateral sulcus and gives branches.
- Branches of internal carotid artery and its supply
- Branches of internal carotid artery *all branch from the cerebral part of the carotid artery*.
- It branches to give:
