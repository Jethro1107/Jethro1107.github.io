		- Superiorly, it gives off the **temporal branch**, which supplies the temple, supraorbital region, and the forehead.
		- The **zygomatic branch** emerge from the anterosuperior border of the parotid gland, and supplies the infraorbital region, lateral areas of the nose, and the upper lip.
		- The **buccal branch** emerges from the anterior borders of the parotid glands, passes over the buccinator, supplying the cheek, and upper lip.
		- The **marginal mandibular branch** emerges from the anteroinferior borders of the parotid gland, and supplies the lower lips and chin.
		- The **cervical branch** emerges from the inferior border of the parotid gland, and supplies the ((63b2a0b7-1d26-4cc0-81b5-47a5fb982314)) .
