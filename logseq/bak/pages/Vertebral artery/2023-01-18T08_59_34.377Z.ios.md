- # Vertebral artery
  collapsed:: true
	- The vertebral artery is a branch of the [[Subclavian artery]].
	- **Course of the vertebral artery**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The vertebral artery ascends through the transverse foramina of C6 to C1 ([[Features of cervical vertebrae]]), where it then passes along the posterior arch of the axis, posterior to the lateral masses, and *enters the skull through the foramen magnum*, piercing the dura mater in its course.
		- It eventually joins the contralateral vertebral artery on the pons to form the basilar artery, forming the **vertebrobasilar complex**.

	- **Branches of the vertebral artery**
	  collapsed:: true
		- The vertebrobasilar complex gives rise to many branches:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Anterior spinal artery, and posterior spinal artery (branch of posterior inferior cerebellar artery) - provides [[Arterial supply of the spinal cord]]
			- Brainstem perforators (pontine arteries)
			- [[Branches of the vertebrobasilar complex provides arterial supply to the cerebellum]]
			- Posterior cerebral artery - providing posterior circulation of the brain ([[Brain circulation]])
