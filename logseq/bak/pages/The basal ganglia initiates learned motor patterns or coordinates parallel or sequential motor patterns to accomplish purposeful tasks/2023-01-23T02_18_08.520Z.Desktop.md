- # The [[Basal ganglia]] initiates learned motor patterns or coordinates parallel or sequential motor patterns to accomplish purposeful tasks
  collapsed:: true
	- The basal ganglia, part of the extrapyramidal system, does not directly execute movements, but is responsible for *initiating learned motor patterns*.
	- The putamen circuitry initiates learned motor patterns
	  collapsed:: true
		- When the cerebral cortex, particularly the premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas ([[Motor cortex]]) generates the desire to move, it stimulates the ((63b385a9-8af8-4e03-87d7-2fe0c991125e)) , often bypassing the caudate nucleus.
		- The putamen (one can consider it as storing a learned motor pattern, similar to storage of a defined function in a python module), then stimulates the internal [[Basal ganglia#Globus pallidus|Globus pallidus]], which stimulates the ventrolateral nucleus of the [[Thalamus]].
		- The ventrolateral nucleus subsequently project to the primary motor cortex, portions of premotor cortex and SMA to execute the motor pattern.

	- The caudate circuitry strings together several motor patterns
	  collapsed:: true
		- The C-shaped ((63b385a9-e193-451a-9865-4931752da77a)) receives signals from all association areas in the [[Cortex]] overlying the caudate nucleus, and integrates the different types of sensory and motor information.
		- It then signals the internal globus pallidus, which passes into the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nucleus of the [[Thalamus]], which then projects to the prefrontal, premotor and supplementary motor areas.
		- The premotor area and SMA puts together the learned motor patterns into a sequence of movements, then stimulate the primary motor cortex.
