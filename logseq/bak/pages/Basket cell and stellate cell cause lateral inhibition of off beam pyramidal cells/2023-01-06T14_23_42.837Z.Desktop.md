- # Basket cell and stellate cell cause lateral inhibition of off beam pyramidal cells
  collapsed:: true
	- When the mossy fibres stimulate the granule cells, it activates the parallel fibres that in turn activate basket cells and stellate cells of the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex.
	- Basket cells and stellate send short axons perpendicular to the parallel fibres of granule cells, which inhibits pyramidal cells.
	- Hence, upon stimulation, it results in lateral inhibition of off beam pyramidal cells, resulting in *disinhibition of neighboring deep cerebellar nuclei and vestibular nuclei*.
