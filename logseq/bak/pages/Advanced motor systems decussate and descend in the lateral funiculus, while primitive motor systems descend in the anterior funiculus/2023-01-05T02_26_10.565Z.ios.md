- Advanced motor systems decussate and descend in the lateral funiculus, while primitive motor systems descend in the anterior funiculus
- More evolutionarily advanced systems such as the lateral corticospinal tract, rubrospinal tract, are crossed fibre systems that descend in the contralateral lateral funiculus.
- More primative motor systems such as the ventral corticospinal tract, tectospinal tract, vestibulospinal tract and reticulospinal tract are uncrosed systems that descend in the ipsilateral anterior funiculus.
- This is why [[From an evolutionarily standpoint, ratio of crossed and uncrossed fibres in the motor system determines how advance the species is]].
